        For the Marketing Acumen Section, you will be shown proprietary videos from Kraftshala and you will need to attempt the questions to apply those concepts. Through this we are checking your overall acumen and your learnability.
Stage 2 of the Admission Process: The shortlisted candidates will then appear for the SOP round. You will need to send in your responses to explain your reason for joining the program. Since the program requires high effort / intent, we need to make sure that your overall motivation is aligned with us. You will get a total of 2-3 days to submit this. Some sample questions for this round can also be found in the above link. You will also be required to submit your educational details and location preferences (for internships / final roles) at this stage. We will release the final offers post this stage.</p>"

Perhaps you can look through some of the testimonials on the website to get a flavour- many of them speak specifically about Kraftshala content.
You will however, get a flavour of the kind of content we create through the screening test since that involves going through some of our proprietary frameworks to attempt the questions.
Apart from this, you can also attend the session on Marketing Careers being taken by Varun Satia, Founder of Kraftshala to get more information on how we teach. You will get access to this if you apply for the program."

It is completely refundable in the following 2 situations –
– if you are unable to clear the program assessment OR if decide to opt out of the course within the first 4 weeks
– if you do not get a job with a minimum CTC of Rs. 4.5 lakhs within 12 months of program completion."

        In case you opt for this, you will need to pay additional fees post getting the job. This fee is to account for the additional effort that Kraftshala team will put in to bring in more companies operating in a given location as well as the additional risk that the team assumes in placing students in a particular city. 
        Here are what the slabs look like: 
        1. If you want to be in Grade 1 city- Delhi NCR (as one entity, including Noida and Gurgaon), Mumbai, or Bangalore: 
        Option1: ₹14k upfront + 4 months salary after you get the job
        Option 2: ₹1,87,500 upfront

      "description": "A question that we get asked at this stage is how do we get so many students placed in marketing roles of 4.5+ in just 20 weeks?
      We don’t. You do. 
      The single biggest factor behind your success is the intent and effort that you put in. You will go through 8-9 hours of training every weekday.
      Our job is to ensure that each of those hours are training you for the skills required to crack the role and succeed in it’. This means conceptual skills like excel, keyword research, media planning, as well as behavioral traits like ‘communication skills’,‘time management’, and more. And based on this, we’ve built the curriculum with people who have worked in these roles on brands like MAGGI, Spotify, Airbnb. 
      Hour after hour after hour we focus on only this.
      That’s how every single graduated student is placed
      That's how we are confident to assure you that if you don't get placed at atleast 4.5L, we wont charge you anything! 
      Your job in all of this is to just immerse yourself. That starts with the screening test. Show us what you’ve got. All the best!",
