The content, projects, feedbacks and assessments – all components are built to help you master the ‘industry’s way’ of doing things to launch a fantastic career. It is not just a program but an industry immersion to support you from training to getting placed in those roles. We do this through –

Guided LIVE projects on business problems to help you apply the concepts 
          We make you step into the shoes of a Brand/Marketing Manager, Performance Marketing Manager to tackle growth problems. You don't just get a 1 line brief but instead get guided charters for each step of the project to learn the process and not just meet the deliverables
          3. Personalised coaching & mentorships at every step to help you course correct
          We make you get feedback from current brand /performance marketing managers. These discussions are focused on helping you apply the concepts well, fill up the gaps of knowledge, if any, and to probe you in different ways to help you think about problem in a more deeper way
          4. INDUSTRYCreds Scores - A Performance matrix to highlight your potential to recruiters
          We don't just train you but also get you assessed from an expert panel of industry interviewers as a part of the Assessment Center at the end of your program. With this, you have a benchmark on how you fared across all Kraftshala students from 50+ B-Schools to showcase your potential to top recruiters. These scores result in direct PPIs in some cases (details available in the program brochure). They are also shared with lots of recruiters to highlight your sales and marketing leadership potential."
