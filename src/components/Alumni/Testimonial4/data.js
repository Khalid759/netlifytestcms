      "I had the opportunity to study the Industry Creds Brand Building course with Kraftshala and the experience has left me so much wiser. I was still looking for my footing in the world of #marketing and #fmcg when we recieved an opportunity to study this course. There is so much to learn, so much to absorb, such eye opening perspectives and theories that I would've never come across in my academic life. This course, including resume building, live projects, interview prep everything that I needed I found in one place. I am grateful to the creators of Kraftshala and Varun Satia to have helped me on this journey to becom a marketer, and I look forward to the many opportunities in my life with renewed vigour because I know, now I am well equipped to battle any challenge that it thrown at me. If its marketing, then bring it on. #kraftshala #industrycreds #marketing #brandbuilding #brand #symbiosis #course #study #interviewprep #marketer #perspectives #fmcg",

      "Got the opportunity to widen my knowledge on Media Planning through Kraftshala Live session which was taken by Chirag Desai (Category Manager, HUL). He touched upon Impressions/GRP and the need for multiple impressions, CPR (Cost per Reach ) and CPIR (Cost per Incremental reach) through a short case study, Media affinity, Choice of Medium and a 2x2 matrix wherein different choice of media were mapped on the 4 quadrants with the parameters being High Cost, Low Cost, High Reach, Low Reach. Sharing my key takeaways here of the session on Big Brand Theory of Media Planning: 1. Always maximize reach at the right frequency in your TG 2. CPIR gives a better indication of the cost of the medium as compared to CPR 3. Think of the media plan before jumping to asset creation 4. Do not buy engagement at the cost of reach 5. Choose the right medium basis the size of the brand, CPIR of medium and complexity of the message 6. Be consistent This is a great initiative by Varun Satia especially in the current scenario and looking forward to such insightful sessions! #QuarantineLearnings #WontStopLearning",

      "Knowledge shared = Knowledge² I enrolled in a Brand Management course by Kraftshala a couple of weeks ago. The course is fantastic but here is what intrigued me- A free and open for all webinar was hosted earlier this evening. It was meant for students in college and in no way related to the course I am taking. I decided to attend it anyway. I was amazed to see how open the team was about sharing its knowledge and resources even with people who had not enrolled with Kraftshala. The concepts were not kept behind a paywall. They were handed out candidly in free webinars. To any student, these will be pieces of invaluable advice /insights which would not only give them a headstart but will go a long way in their career. (most online learning platforms would demand a paid subscription for this level of knowledge sharing.) Really heartwarming to see such initiatives! Great work - Varun Satia, Eshu Sharma  #onlinelearning #kraftshala #marketing #webinars",

    description: `As a part of winning team of the National level Marketing case study competition "Markcase- 2019" organized by IIM Lucknow in collaboration with Kraftshala, our team got an opportunity to pursue the "Digital Brand Building" IndustryCred certification program . I must say the design of these newly founded Industry Cred courses are unique & insightful. It is done such that one has to pursue it while going through the rigourous 1st year classes. This is something really commendable Kraftshala team ! The fundamental sessions are followed up by weekly submissions on the allocated industry specific problem for which we get realtime feedback from Industry experts of concerned brands. Moreover frequent webinars on nuances & concepts of digital marketing helped us to widen up our horizons in this trending subject of marketing. After 2 months of the programme I feel obliged to be a part of this learning experience. Thank you Kraftshala ! Thanks to the founders Varun Satia, Eshu Sharma for bringing us to such a collaborative E- learning platform that made me inclined a bit more towards Marketing. Thanks to the whole team who were always there to help proactively. #sessions #learningexperience #elearning #digitalbrandbuilding #brandbuilding #marketing #learnfromhome #kraftshala `,

      "Not long ago, I came across a movie trailer breakdown video. I don't generally follow reaction videos but the concept of decoding a trailer seemed interesting. I wanted to see how this would be different from the rest of the reaction videos. As they say, the devil is in the detail. At the end of it, I was quite intrigued by the attention paid to tiny details, how all the bits and pieces added up & everything made sense. I had an aha! moment. 2 days ago I attended a webinar called Delhi Election Campaign Decoded organised by Kraftshala and hosted by Varun Satia. There's a lot of criticism on the internet about these campaigns that doesn't teach you much. This webinar, however, reminded me of one of those breakdown videos. Varun beautifully broke down the campaigns of the parties and explained with the help of consumer behaviour, brand building concepts and frameworks why each party has designed the campaigns the way it did, what communication challenge they tried to address, what went well/wrong, how their campaigns evolved from the past, by taking us through the tiny details some of which we could've missed. I always look forward to attending their webinars which are hosted by some of the best marketeers. Thanks for bringing great content to us, team Kraftshala! ",

      "Progressive Hypothesis Setting. This is a technique I came across during my live project on digital brand building with Kraftshala. I was posed with a problem statement that the revenue of an e-commerce firm is not increasing and I was supposed to identify potential reasons for the same. This was when PHS came handy. In a PHS exercise, you start with a problem which is stagnating revenue in our case. Then you try to divide the problem into smaller issues and then go on to break these issues further into the most granular form possible. I used a software called Freemind to build a mind map which represents the process in the form of a multi level diagram. You can find the mind map below. The mind map is obviously not perfect given I used it for the first time but this indeed is a good method to diagnose and dissect problems in organisations to better strategize and tackle the issues at hand. Suggestions and modifications are welcome. #problemsolving #revenue #marketing #digitalmarketing #learning",

    description: `It took 4 months, 21 projects and two final assessments with a whole lot of brainstorming, slogging, getting the right pitch, achieving harmony and accord in the group and a plethora of communication and presentation skills to arrive at this point. After an unfortunate and devastating experience with my former organization owing to the nationwide pandemic that grappled economy and individual livelihood and mentality, I was standing on a platform where the trains had already left the station and desolation surrounded me from everywhere. It took some tinge of zeal and passion to engross myself with a course that might change my way of thinking and projecting my mind. And , then resorted to the exercise of being "Productive" and a period of "Struggle" commenced . These two are the most talked about words in the dictionary nowadays for the entire nation irrespective of your field or domain. Numerous sleepless nights went by ,working on various brand projects and learning a complete new eco-sysytem of marketing and branding in today's age , actually incorporated that confidence which was highly required. There are a host of people that i would like to thank and be forever grateful to them for being a part in this entire journey. 
      I am forever grateful to a host of people who shaped my journey. I will try to be crisp and short. Varun Satia and Eshu Sharma for giving us this incredible experience and for starting this platform which creates storytellers and brand experts out of anything. Abhishek Acharya, for your expert sessions where you made digital marketing as a palatable tool for us. <,>Surbhi Jain, for keeping up with us , tolerating us , and overlooking our time management issues! :P , and definitely for being the best buddy manager. Neha Vij, for introducing me to the world within (I still remember how we started off, by the way! :D) And lastly, my team. Aarti Hasani, Satish Konar, Arjun Pratap Singh for being the best team ever. B for Brandetta, I will always keep this name etched in my heart. All the best folks , for your upcoming exam. I am sure you all will come out with flying colors. #Kraftshala #IndustryCreds #ProfessionalBrandManagement #LearningsinLockdown #Branding #Marketing #BrandManagerchronicles #Certifications #Skilldevelopment #Dontstoplearning #Digitalage #joblossdontgiveadamm #personalbranding #Brandmanagementpeers #pandemicwontstopus`,
