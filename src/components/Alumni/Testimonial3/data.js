    description: `There is a significant skill/reality gap between what is taught in 
    schools vs what Sales & Marketing Jobs require today. My passion always lay in 
    core consumer marketing – and I undertook the Kraftshala course to be able to 
    gain real brand management knowledge – and to compete on an even footing in the 
    Indian market after starting my career internationally.
    I think there were many sensible practical insights as well as interaction with 
    industry professionals which bridged quite a bit of the gap in knowledge. Thanks a lot!`,

    description: `Nestle PPI was unbelievable because I had no prior knowledge on the
    subject matter! There were a few all-nighters, but it was totally
    worth it. My objective was to learn as much from the videos and
    assignments so that I can perform better at my internship. And that
    motivation helped me to get a good score and finally an offer from
    Nestle.`,

    description: `Kraftshala not just provides a learning platform, but mentorship and
    support which lasts much after the course is over. Talking to experts
    from and via Kraftshala really helped me take informed decisions and
    gave a boost to my confidence. I would recommend everybody to become a
    part of the Kraftshala family.`,
