Since marketing is best done by discussing and exchanging ideas, this is core aspect of the program experience and it very closely mirrors how you will be working in real life as well.

        To give you our perspective, there are tons of things happening in the marketing world and this is the one program which brings it all together for you. At Kraftshala we believe that within a 4-5 years, almost all marketing will be digital, and there would be a small percentage left outside that. So it’s important to learn the digital media tools, but that's the easy part. What’s more valuable is figuring how to use them in the entire brand building/ marketing funnel, and this is what the Professional Brand Management in the Digital Age program is all about. Also, marketing after a while is all about articulation (how well you are able to write your briefs, how well can you give feedback to the agency, how persuasively you can present your ideas) which is completely dependent on the clarity of thought and that is the aspect that we work on through and through.
