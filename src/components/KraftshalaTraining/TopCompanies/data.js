      "<div>A big thanks to Kraftshala for unprecedented support in terms of their professionalism, their talent pool and a fast turnaround time. It gives me a lot of faith that you have the best selection criteria on campus given the kind of talent we had on the project. Not only did they have a basic appreciation of the industry, but were also behaviourally sound, given the fast paced research that was needed. <div>Overall we are very delighted with the quality and the time in which the project was delivered and <b> I would be more than willing to use this as a great route to hire talent in the future</b></div>  </div>",
