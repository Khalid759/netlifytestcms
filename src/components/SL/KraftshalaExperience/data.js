    INDUSTRYCreds™ certification helped me understand marketing aspects
    from a practical world perspective. The content is clearly
    structured and I loved the examples in the course which helps during
    interviews. I also got access to mentors like Gaurav Gupta, HRBP,
    Boehringer Ingleheim who helped me understand my CV better. It
    helped me during my final placements as well. It was one of the many
    factors which helped me secure an offer from Novo Nordisk.”`,

    desc: `I had my internship in HUL. But as the summer approached, I was very
    anxious about my performance at the internship. Some of the seniors
    at campus had done Kraftshala Courses and they were known to have
    good marketing knowledge. So one day, out of my anxiety I logged on
    to Kraftshala website and the inspirational video on the page
    triggered me immediately to join the course. Kraftshala’s Brand
    Building course kept me on my toes and honed my skills in marketing.
    With the live project, I even improved my presentation skills. It
    was a holistic course which touched on various points: Theory,
    examples, brands, consumer love and ppt. There were specific
    guidelines &amp; feedback from industry professionals for the project
    which made the whole process more enjoyable. During my internship
    also , I referred my notes to get into more of marketing. Words are
    few as BB course helps you a lot, the results you will notice when
    the way you see and talk about different brands reflect in your
    conversations. I did not bag the PPO but when I got the Nestle offer
    through my INDUSTRYCreds score and the subsequent interview, I was
    overjoyed. Thanks Kraftshala family, who has stood with me
    throughout my MBA.`,

    desc: `Kraftshala has been a true mentor to me throughout my B School
    journey! Kraftshala joined me on my journey when I needed it the
    most, during summer placements, in the form of Summers Pro program.
    With good results from that experience I took up another
    Kraftshala’s program as soon as it was launched. The course content
    is just half of the story, what I loved abt Kraftshala the most is
    the support they provide in realising our true potential. It could
    have been as easy as, u pay fees, do online course, submit
    deliverables, get report csrd and then tata bye bye. This isn't the
    case with Kraftshala, their actual value add starts after the course
    has ended. They've alloted me mentorship slots to help me with
    anything and everything right from CV review to mock interviews and
    all of the mentors are active industry professionals who have been
    through same journey as ours. That's just not it, they personally
    call up and check why I haven't utilized any mentorship sessions,
    ask me what kinda guidance I'm looking at and then allot mentor as
    per that. I mean who does this much? Certainly not somebody who's
    here for profiteering but somebody who genuinely wants to help you.
    This really gains my respect form them as an organization and as a
    service provider. And this is exact reason why I consider Kraftshala
    as my true mentor.`,

    desc: `Initially, I was very doubtful of joining an online course as I was
    not very sure of the kind of learning. But the course caught my
    attention right from the very first screening test which tested the
    applicative Sales &amp; Marketing skills. This was very much different
    from what we usually learn at our B-schools. This was kind of a
    sneak peek into the job life of a Sales/Marketing manager. This
    preliminary course module actually changed my mind and led me to the
    decision of enrolling for the course. It was only a week into the
    course that I started to get a real feel of the job of a Brand
    Manager. The subsequent modules and weekly tasks were a perfect way
    of delivering the course. I cannot stress enough on the fact that
    how closely related this course is with the actual job of a Brand
    Manager. With the regular expert/coach feedbacks help you keep on
    track with the right approach of thinking about the case problem
    statements by providing critical feedback on our weekly submissions.
    To add to our aid, we have the discussion forum to post our doubts
    and discuss with our fellow Kraftians as well as our program buddy
    to help with any issue with the case submissions. To summarize my
    journey, I would say that after this program and my continuing
    association with Kraftshala, I have emerged a better Marketing
    student and definitely have come many steps closer to being a Brand
    Manager.`,

    as a part of Sales leadership program while I was in my first year.
    As a part of the program I was responsible to step in the shoes of
    an Area Sales Manager and perform set tasks that an ASM is expected
    to perform on a daily basis. The experience was enriching,
    interacting with multiple stakeholders, looking at the product
    offerings, learning the market, devising actionable pointers. All of
    these combined with seamless and well guided mentorships, and crisp
    connecting theory made the program a journey. I would go on to say
    that the love I have for sales and marketing right now, is a direct
    by-product of the program I undertook.`,

    desc: `The entire journey of starting the Sales Leadership till the final
    announcement of results are best described by three Es: exhaustive,
    enlightening and engaging. The course exhaustively covers most of
    the concepts that a MBA student will come across, it’s enlightening
    as the concepts are something which are not always taught during the
    MBA curriculum and thus helps us get a broader lens to view context.
    The content covers interviews with various accomplished industry
    stalwarts which helps to keep us grounded to reality. The
    submissions helped me get a practical exposure by going to physical
    retail outlets, learning how to talk to customers (strangers) and
    derive quality insights, the submission was also analyzed in-depth
    by the reviewers and we got quality feedback which helped develop
    our understanding even better. In totality, the course, the Kraft
    community has helped me learn concepts, build a strong network, land
    internships, win case study competitions and thus, excel till now.`,

    desc: `Kraftshala has given me access to some amazing humans - as friends,
    guides/mentors and well-wishers. I went on to commence my SummersPro
    certification with them, excited and equally uncertain. Most of my
    SIP (Summer Internship Program) interviews revolved around my
    SummersPro Certification and the work I had done here. The gift of
    narrative is what I developed. The ability to treat interviews as
    exchange of experiences and not an evaluation portrays confidence
    and recruiters pick you for that – ProTip! Fast Forwarding the
    Journey, to May 2020, when I received the certification for my
    second course with Kraftshala. This one was an entirely different
    journey, where I worked with two other people on a project by
    Nestlé. The takeaways transformed from just awareness and exposure
    to application-based learning and on-field assignments. The right
    content put across in a manner that helps (not just in training
    oneself) but aids you in the decision as to what you want to do a
    couple of years down the line in the Sales &amp; Marketing Domain. To
    summarise, it is more than just a certification. It is a
    culmination, mutual exchange of experiences and handholding that
    they indulge in. It is needed, they give you direction at essential
    junctures of your B-School Journey.`,
