              ‚ÄúI cannot narrow it down to a particular one thing about
              Kraftshala that helped me. It's about how their online sales
              training course in its entirety familiarised me with the marketing
              concepts through rich content and the application of those
              concepts through live projects. Doing the projects with
              Kraftshala's Sales Leadership program gave me an understanding of
              how things work and thus during internship gave me a headstart in
              understanding the processes and working my way through my
              internship project more productively‚Äù
