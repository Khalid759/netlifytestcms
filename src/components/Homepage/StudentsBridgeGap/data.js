      "Studying at Kraftshala was the first time I've been so interested in learning and self educating myself. Unlike other education, here we were taught how to work on real life projects, and how to implement strategies which you are actually going to use when you go out in the corporate world. It's really a good online course and I haven’t come across anything like this in these years of my education. Post this program, I have become more disciplined, my marketing acumen has increased a lot, I've learned how to look at things from different perspectives and come up with insights and also I have learned to sit for long hours at one place.",

Specifically, on digital - I was new to it. I tried learning it on my own. But I figured that learning myself would only give me the base information, and not the actual hands-on experience. But with Kraftshala, you get to learn and master the methodology that is used in the industry. Now, I’m neck-to-neck with someone who is experienced as a Digital Marketer!",

These were the things which I learned from Kraftshala. I didn't know how to start in this field but I am on the right path now, just because of Kraftshala. I just want to say that if you have a passion for marketing and need a streamlined online training, then there is no better place than Kraftshala.",

Overall, the kind of handholding support Kraftshala gives you, you just move on with them, you just be with them, with the flow and they will take you across the ocean. As an MLP student, honestly, we have left our lives to Kraftshala. They know what to deliver and they know what not to deliver.    ",
