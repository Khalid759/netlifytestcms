              The sector of medical devices can be best explained as the
              combination of Pharma & FMCG. Where you be selling the medical
              devices to doctors, clinics & hospitals. Not only this, you’ll
              also have the opportunity to work with various healthcare boards,
              authorities, insurance companies which will also give you a good
              flavour of B2B from time to time. A career in healthcare (medical
              devices) will help you gain dual experience both pharma & FMCG.
            </div>

            <div className="mtop-2">
              To help you with this, we are going to decode a project to give
              you an idea about how to approach your summers project in
              Healthcare (Medical Devices).

              Improving market access of medical devices in the cardiology space

              <h3>Project Brief</h3>
            </div>
            <div>
              Aoston Scientific develops and distributes high end precision
              medical devices to be used by doctors and surgeons for performing
              medical procedures on patients with cardiac ailments. Key
              stakeholders, other than medical practitioners and patients, in
              the procedure are insurance companies: since more often than not
              it is, they who provide coverage to patients undergoing these
              surgeries and bear costs for the same. Insurance plans that
              customers buy from all major insurance companies often
              specifically include or exclude certain procedures that can be
              covered in the insurance coverage of the patient. For the
              insurance company to cover the costs of the medial procedure the
              device used in the procedure needs to be ‘institutionalized’ by
              the insurance company. To achieve the institutionalized status a
              device needs to be deemed fit as a feasible solution in term of 2
              parameters: health of patients and financial costs of insurance
              companies.
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              As a key provider of medical devices used in these procedures the
              onus is on Aoston Scientific to create products that meet the
              standards of all stakeholders. In order to achieve this a health
              economic evaluation of all devices is necessary. These devices
              must benefit patients who are treated from their use while being
              economically viable and scalable for use. The goal is to get
              devices institutionalized by IRDA (Insurance Regulatory and
              Development Authority) to improve market access as more patients
              will be willing to undergo treatment if costs are covered in
              insurance and medical institutions will also encourage treatment.

                  The first phase of the project included understanding the
                  medical devices industry from a macro perspective including
                  who the different stakeholders were and how they interacted
                  with one another. This was done through an orientation
                  organized for the interns where the internal teams at Aoston
                  Scientific explained the organization and its functions in
                  detail.
                </li>
                <li>
                  After the projects were allocated, micro level research had to
                  be done to understand the 3 cardio devices and their
                  performance in order to proceed with a health economic
                  evaluation. This was done through interactions with an
                  internal team of doctors.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Conversations with key opinion leaders in the medical space
                  helped to understand the differences in medical procedures
                  performed with and without the use of Aoston Scientific’s
                  devices. Alternatives to device based procures were also
                  understood and benchmarked in terms of benefits in patient
                  recovery.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A list of parameters was created and given weights to quantify
                  the health aspect of the health-economic analysis. Data for
                  these parameters was obtained through primary and secondary
                  research from doctor and patient interviews along with medical
                  journals respectively.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In depth interviews with doctors and Key Opinion Leaders
                  included questions about the working of the devices, alternate
                  treatment procedures available, selection criteria of patients
                  in terms of which procedures they choose from available
                  alternatives, cases in which the device could or could not be
                  used and how device usage could aid patient recovery.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Patients who had undergone cardio procedures were interviewed
                  and asked about their recovery, factors that make them opt for
                  a particular procedure, post procedure effects and long as
                  well as short run effects.
                </li>
                <li>
                  To quantify the economic aspect of the procedures the initial
                  cost was taken into consideration as well as subsequent costs
                  post procedure eg) re-hospitalization costs if any, post
                  procedure care costs, costs of medicines
                </li>
                <li>
                  An excel model was created to compare short run and long run
                  costs of procedures carried out with devices and alternate
                  procedures available. It was found that while the economic
                  costs of device based procedures were higher in the short run,
                  in the long run alternate treatments would cost more primarily
                  due to re-hospitalization required due to their inferior
                  quality.
                </li>
                <li>
                  On the basis of this research the model was initially verified
                  by internal teams before being sent to IRDA for approval.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A pitch deck for device institutionalization was also created
                  emphasizing the higher re-admission costs that insurance
                  companies would have to entail when inferior quality alternate
                  procedures would be performed on patients since it would be
                  the insurance companies that would have to pay for these
                  re-admission costs as well.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Post submission to IRDA a marketing plan had to be created to
                  pitch the Aoston Scientific devices to hospitals. A doctor
                  referral and review system was suggested where KoLs and
                  experts in the cardiology space were asked to review the BS
                  devices in medical journals. C
                </li>
                <li>
                  Compliance and legal teams were worked with in close
                  collaboration to marketing team in order to carry out these
                  marketing activities legally and ethically.

                  The medical devices space is extremely technical and being a
                  business student, it took a lot of effort in gaining
                  familiarity with terms that Key Opinion Leaders and doctors
                  used in their communication. Before taking interviews and
                  making sense of them a lot of secondary research and
                  self-teaching had to be done.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Marketing of medical devices on the basis of mathematically
                  done analysis to other business entities: insurance companies
                  and compliance aggregating organizations: IRDA was very unlike
                  the usual B2C low involvement category marketing we are often
                  exposed to at B-school.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Getting appointments with KoLs and doctors was also
                  challenging as they are busy people who have little time to
                  answer an intern’s questions.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Gathering data from patients and asking them sensitive
                  questions about health and finances was a challenge. Since
                  each case was different turning quantitative feedback to
                  qualitative numbers was also a challenge that was overcome
                  with the support various of internal teams.
