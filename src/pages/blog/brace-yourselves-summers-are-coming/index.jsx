              So you went through the summer placement process, dealt with
              grueling group discussions and interview & emerged triumphant at
              the other end with an internship offer at a prestigious company!
              Now is the time you want to kick back and enjoy everything else a
              B-school has to offer, and while you are entitled to do that, it
              is imperative to register what is coming around the corner- the
              actual internship. You will have 8 weeks to work on your allotted
              project wherein you will hopefully learn a whole lot about your
              domain, the corporate life and most importantly, yourself. And at
              the end, if you have worked very hard, you will be rewarded with a
              pre-placement interview (PPI) or a pre-placement offer (PPO) from
              the company.
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              Getting a PPO is easier said than done. Looking at numbers, the
              PPO conversion rate can be as low as 10 percent, i.e. only one
              intern in ten lands a pre-placement opportunity. The best
              conversion rate among companies is around 25 percent. And then
              there are some ‘crazy’ stories as well. A graduate from a premiere
              B-school interned in a famous Indian conglomerate puts it into
              context for us, “Summers can get really crazy. A role of dice
              decides what company you will be allotted a project in, and you
              soon realise that some companies are held dearer than others. We
              were placed in 23 companies but interns from only the top 8
              received PPOs. When I entered my post summers interview and
              announced my company’s name, half the panel didn’t know it
              existed! Moreover I had received an operations project but I was
              interviewed by the head of communications and the head of finance,
              neither of whom knew a lot about operations!”
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              Usually right amidst the happy ones who ‘lurvved’ their summers,
              you will seem to find plenty of interns who say, “It’s very
              random, yaar”, “My mentor wasn’t available”, “My tutor did not
              give me much time” etc. Yes there are external factors that are
              uncontrollable, but hard work and dedication always shines
              through. With the right attitude and preparation you can get the
              best out of your summers, and a PPO is just a natural culmination
              of a really good internship.
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              The truth is that as an intern you aren’t so much being judged on
              your specific project, or on the role you hope to land a PPO for.
              You are being judged for your potential for learning & growth that
              you show. As Keith Bevans, the global head of consultant
              recruiting for Bain & Co put it, “It’s not about showing you can
              learn a job in 10 weeks. It’s about showing you can learn the job
              when you arrive full time.” In this article we will cover a few
              things you can do to get your head into the game and the next
              article would put light on the best practices one should follow on
              a day to day basis in the internship, to get the most out of the
              summers.

              <h3>Get…Set…Go!</h3>
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              You might have talked to your seniors and they would have told you
              how grueling the internship is. As one final year student
              succinctly put it, “They drop you into the deep end of the pool,
              and expect you to figure out how to swim”. The company has spent a
              lot of time and money to carefully select, from a pool of hundreds
              of students, the chosen few from the premiere B-schools of India.
              You will have eight weeks to prove your mettle. On one hand this
              is a much larger time frame than a single interview. Students who
              are nervous in interviews would consider the summer internship to
              be a blessing in disguise. Your work speaks for you, even if words
              fail you. It is hard to keep a good candidate down!
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              On the other hand, all the summer interns working with you in the
              company hail from premiere B-schools and are equally eager to land
              a PPO. This is a conundrum even the company faces – how do you
              choose among a pool of meritorious candidates? The difference
              comes from subtle shifts in attitude and behaviour. Interns who
              are well-prepared and have an enthusiastic bent of mind stand out
              from the very first day. As any psychologist will tell you, first
              impressions are important. Humans tend to stubbornly cling on to
              their first impressions about another. If we form a positive
              attitude towards someone, it will take a larger proportion of
              contrary evidence for us to change our opinion. We intuitively
              tend to retain information that confirms our initial opinion and
              dismiss contrary information as mere coincidence. This works both
              ways, however, so you should try hard to form positive first
              impressions. Ask the right questions and act proactively to create
              a good first impression.
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              A summer internship is kind of a trial period, where the company
              can closely observe the work ethic and behaviour of prospective
              employees and employ the few who they feel would be a good fit for
              the company’s culture. You can consider it an extended evaluation
              of sorts; and a lot of top Indian companies only hire full-time
              employees from their pool of summer interns
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              Remember, time isn’t a friend for summer interns. It takes interns
              a couple of weeks to understand the work and get attuned to the
              work culture, and it isn’t uncommon to realize that half of the
              internship duration is over before you even figure out a plan of
              action for your project and decide how to go about it. Hence ever
              so much reason to get going right from the start. One of the first
              things you can do is to find out what kind of projects summer
              interns have done before you, and a great starting point is this
              list of S&M summer internship projects across 90+ companies.

              <h2>Seniors Are a Treasure Trove of Knowledge</h2>
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              Your seniors can provide you with a lot of insights about the
              summer internship. They were in the same place you are but a year
              ago, and are familiar with the apprehensions that are currently
              plaguing you. While it is important that you learn the number of
              corporate parties the company organises and which food items to
              try out in the cafeteria, also try and find out the kind of
              problems your seniors faced during the internship. Ensure that you
              have lengthy conversations with all previous interns in the same
              company and/or domain. For example, if your summer internship is
              in Airtel try to speak to previous interns not only from Airtel
              but also Vodafone, Idea and other telecom firms. Learn from them
              about the work culture and the projects they undertook.
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              Try and talk to multiple people to avoid being influenced by
              biased opinions, and also to get a more holistic idea about the
              company/domain.Ask probing questions and try to understand the
              subtleties of the work culture. It will help you avoid making the
              same mistakes and identify early cues that you may be doing
              something wrong.

            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              Pull up your socks and start prepping skills which might be useful
              during your summer internship. Microsoft Excel, for example, is
              something all sales and marketing interns need to be able to use
              comfortably. Before the start of your internship learn how to use
              tools like ‘What-if’ analysis, solver, pivot tables and
              conditional formatting. YouTube videos can be a good resource that
              you can use.
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              To get into the groove, read up on popular success stories of
              brands and campaigns that were successfully executed. Online
              newsletters and websites like Afaqs, AdAge etc. are good sources
              to keep up with the marketing current affairs, but remember to try
              to create your own perspective on the marketing news you read. It
              is also important to learn about sales and distribution networks,
              since a majority of sales and marketing interns are given sales
              projects. Revise statistics and learn how to conduct research. A
              lot of marketing interns are required to conduct consumer research
              and administer surveys. Pre-reading on the topic will help you
              avoid common mistakes that interns often make while creating
              surveys, for example choosing a biased sample, asking leading
              questions that lead to inaccurate results etc. Ofcourse, to make
              sure you don’t fumble around at all and are prepared with
              comprehensive industry knowledge and experience in solving actual
              business challenges, programs like IndustryCreds in Brand Building
              & Sales Leadership serve to bridge the gap in addition to
              providing additional PPI opportunities.
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              Last but not the least, read up about the company. It is important
              to know the values the company stands for and the traits they
              value. Read up on their product portfolio and different CSR
              activities. This knowledge will help you make conversation, if
              needed, with the HR, and also portray you as someone eager to join
              the company.
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              To conclude we would like to stress that you only get one summer
              internship. It is a unique learning opportunity, unlike any other
              you will get during your MBA tenure. This is when you get to try
              out in real time all that you have learnt in theory. It gives you
              a sneak-peek into the domain and helps you decide what kind of a
              career you want to pursue. While this is an opportunity for the
              company to decide whether you are a good fit for the organization,
              the intern too gets to judge whether this is the company and
              domain he/she wants to work in. It helps you develop the skills
              you require to succeed in the workplace afterwards.
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              Remember you only reap what you sow. Hard work during your summer
              internship and the preparation you put in beforehand will not only
              help you learn invaluable skills and gain experience in the domain
              but in most cases will also translate into a PPO. Dedicated
              efforts will surely be rewarded. Go forth confidently, and
              conquer!
