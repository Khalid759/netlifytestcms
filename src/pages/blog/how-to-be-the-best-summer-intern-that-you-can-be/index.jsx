              Legend has it that there was once a time when summer internships
              used to just be a small window of experience for the novice
              business students, a window through which they would peep into the
              corporate world for 2 months. Ah, how have the times changed!
              Summers have increasingly become the most preferred way that
              companies recruit candidates. Here, we have created a list of
              things that you can do to make sure that you get the most out of
              your summers:
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              <b>1.Communication with Your Mentor:</b> The first step to
              delivering effective solutions is to be clear as to what the
              problem is. Do not mince words. Do not try to conform. Discuss
              with your mentor what your project is and ensure that you are
              clear about the deliverables along with the timeline of each.
              After having discussed your project charter, make sure you write a
              mail stating in your language what exactly do you need to do. This
              would ensure that you are exactly on the same page as your mentor
              regarding what is expected of you.
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              <b>2. Curiosity:</b> Summer internships provide a galore of
              learning opportunities.You will get to experience practically a
              lot of what you had only read in textbooks till now. Ask questions
              on everything you don’t understand. Ask as many questions as
              possible, and then ask some more. It shows that you are motivated
              and eager to learn.

            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              <b>3. Knowledge + Perspective:</b> First impressions matter and
              the way to make your firsts click is to be interested in the
              company and the industry. Remain updated about the new trends
              coming up in the field and how your company is positioned to make
              headway with these new trends. Marketing interns can refer to
              AdAge, Advertising Week, Brand Equity or Afaqs. Public relations
              and communications inters should read PRWeek; social media
              interns, Mashable. Finance interns should read the Wall Street
              Journal. Accounting interns, The Journal of Accountancy. Sign up
              for Google Alerts so that you receive notifications on sector
              news. Take note of upcoming trends, major players, holding
              companies and thought leaders. Also do not forget that even more
              important than information is perspective. Have a perspective on
              what you read. Even if you are blatantly wrong, you are far ahead
              of others who just read without thought.
            </div>

            <div className="mtop-2">
              <b>4. Daily Goals: </b> Everyday prepare a daily log of things you
              want to achieve that day. At the end of the day, take note of all
              that you managed to achieve and the key learning you gained. 8
              weeks fly by quicker than you would expect, and to make optimum
              use of your time, track daily deadlines and the work completed. It
              will also help you understand which tasks you excel at and need
              less time to finish, and which ones you need to work upon.
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              <b>5. Take Initiative:</b> It’s the interns who get just as
              involved with projects as actual employees, if not more, who truly
              stand out. If the opportunity arises, volunteer your opinions.
              Just be sure to back them up with a logical explanation. If your
              manager asks for suggestions on a project, speak up. If they want
              volunteers for an extra assignment, volunteer. These are sure-fire
              ways to stand out and ensure that you create a memorable
              impression. Taking initiative when given opportunities also shows
              your supervisors that you can be a valuable asset to the team.
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              If you have a good idea, do not hesitate to share it. Companies
              want interns to give a fresh perspective. The worst thing an
              intern can do to himself/herself is to accept status quo. Question
              things, and try to find new vantage points to inspect things from.
              Make mistakes. Never repeat them. In fact, if you have made no
              mistakes in 2 months, that is the biggest mistake you could have
              made!
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              <b>6. Be the millennial:</b> With the advent of the internet and
              social media, marketing has undergone a radical transformation.
              The entire world is going digital, and as a millennial, there is
              an expectation that new media is second nature to you. You can be
              really valuable by providing sharp consumer insights as well as a
              fresh new perspective to people who have already been in the
              industry for years, and have naturally become prone to looking at
              the picture the same way.
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              <b>7. Socialize:</b> Internships are a great opportunity to build
              long-lasting corporate relationships. Your supervisors and
              co-workers may be immersed in projects and deadlines, so make sure
              you take the initiative to introduce yourself and exhibit a genial
              and jovial attitude to everyone you meet. Remember, the interns
              who deliver the best projects are the ones who are able to get
              people excited about their work, trespass hierarchy and create
              relationships to quickly get vital information.
            </div>

            <div className="mtop-2">
              <b>8. Ask more from your tutor:</b> One way to show your
              commitment to the company and the project allotted to you is to go
              above and beyond what is expected of you. If your supervisor asks
              for three alternatives, provide four. If you find yourself with
              nothing to do, ask for another assignment. Not only will you be
              busy learning new things, but you will also impress your mentors.
              Do not treat your internship with a lackadaisical attitude where
              you only do as much is asked from you and not an iota more. One
              caveat: be careful to finish all your other assignments before you
              ask for more work. Do not use the excuse of having too much work
              to slack off your earlier commitments.
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              <b>9. Discipline:</b> Highlight your commitment to the job through
              punctuality and hard work. Show up for meetings and one-on-ones on
              time. Keep buffers and be accountable.
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              <b>10. Present a holistic perspective:</b> Interns are usually
              given a lot of execution work. However you are expected to not
              only understand how to do that job, but also why are you doing it.
              You should try to build in the perspective wherein you understand
              where your little job fits into the full scheme of things. If you
              show an understanding of that perspective, that is when you are
              set. Try and work with multiple stakeholders of the company. Talk
              not only to the marketing manager but also the supply chain
              manager, the operations manager, the person in charge of finance
              and so on. All of them will be able to provide you with different
              inputs and insights, and these will help make your final
              presentation more holistic.
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              <b>11. The Big Picture:</b> While making your presentation to the
              senior management keep in mind the bigger picture. You should be
              thorough with every nook and cranny details of your project, but
              unless asked to delve into it, you are not supposed to get
              everything out in front of upper management. Have answers to the
              bigger picture. So, not just details of what you are doing and how
              you are doing, but why are you doing it. For example, if your
              project is about managing media for a specific channel, you should
              obviously understand everything about the channel, but should also
              understand why did you not choose any other channel? Why is this
              channel a priority at all?
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              To conclude, we would like to re-emphasize that internship success
              requires motivation and a true desire to learn. Successful interns
              take the initiative to learn as much as possible during the short
              duration of their internship experience, and their eagerness
              shines through their work. Enter the office with eagerness, a
              positive attitude and a smile; and try and make the best of your
              short time with the company. As H. Jackson said, “If you are doing
              your best, you won’t have anytime to worry about failure”.
