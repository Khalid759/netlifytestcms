            </div>
            <div>
              Currently, LES Bank offers checking account debit cards to account
              holders through the MasterCard and RuPay platforms only. These
              payment networks facilitate transactions made with their cards
              between the merchant’s bank and LES Bank. A chunk of the total
              transaction amount is deducted from the purchase by the acquirer.
              The biggest division is the interchange fee: the money collected
              by banks for their part in the transaction. These rates are set by
              payment networks. Since the VISA platform is not integrated with
              LES Bank Debit cards, LES Bank has lower bargaining power with
              MasterCard and account holders do not have the benefit of choice
              between VISA and MasterCard cards that come with their own set of
              offering and benefits.
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              A white space that exits in LES Bank’s debit card portfolio is
              co-branding cards that leverage synergic partnerships as well as a
              debit card for ultra-high net worth individual. LES Bank is
              looking to explore these untapped opportunities through strategic
              partnerships and customer centric offerings.

                <li>
                  The project started out by studying the existing debit card
                  market in India including payment networks and all
                  stakeholders that take part in the transaction. Internal
                  company reports as well as publicly available information on
                  the web were studied for a foundational understanding on the
                  subject.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The debit card offerings of 10 largest banks operating in
                  India (LES Bank’s competitors) were carefully studied and
                  mapped as per price points and value provided to card holders.
                  This research was majorly done though bank portals.
                </li>
                <li>
                  White spaces and gaps were identified in the debit card market
                  where LES Bank did not have a presence, but competitors were
                  present to cater to consumer’s needs. Eg) Lxis Bank provided a
                  high value Burgandi Card for ultra-high net worth individuals.
                  This offering was absent in LES Bank’s card portfolio.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In in-death analysis of LES Bank debit cards’ benefits was
                  done which was used for a cost-value analysis to determine
                  which benefits to add, replace or eliminate for each card type
                  and its target customer. The cost parameters consisted of
                  annual fee and initial fee while the value parameters were
                  sought from primary research.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Primary research in the form of interviewing bank branch
                  managers as well as existing customers generated insights on
                  most used and desirable card benefits. Upon visits to brank
                  branches; managers were asked what their customers were
                  looking for most in a debit card and other customer recruiting
                  questions through a survey. Customers were asked to rate
                  several card benefits from most to least desirable.
                </li>
                <li>
                  It was found that certain niche benefits such as car rental
                  coupons were not being utilized by customers and broader
                  benefits that came with payment platforms such as airport
                  lounge access were the most desirable.
                </li>
                <li>
                  An excel model was made to gauge white spaces within the cost
                  value framework and 3/5 of VISA’s debit card offerings were
                  found suitable to onboard: Signature, Infinite and Platinum.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Meetings with the internal digital banking team and with VISA
                  initiated talks to onboard the payment network. These talks
                  were however suspended mid-way after LES Banks’ high risk
                  financial exposure came to light and the senior management
                  decided against the deal as current products would have
                  required changes in backend and frontend operations in line
                  with VISA integration.
                </li>
                <li>
                  After suspension of talks with VISA the project focused on
                  co-branding cards which was another white space that LES bank
                  where had no presence, but competition did. Eg) Lxis bank and
                  Qlipkart’s co-branded card. This card provided customers
                  cashbacks and extra savings on purchases made on Qlipkart and
                  all its subsidiaries along with saving on fuel, movie ticket
                  booking etc.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Synergistic partnerships of several E-commerce players with
                  LES Bank were explored and co-branded card offerings were
                  suggested on the basis of unique potential partnerships.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A cashback card model was found to me most desirable from
                  primary research and a model for the same was created with
                  different cashback percentages offered for transactions on
                  platforms of co-branded merchants, preferred partner merchants
                  and all other merchants.

                  Being a marketing intern in a finance focused company led me
                  weigh various alternatives in a twofold manner. One, from the
                  perspective of whether it made business sense financially and
                  the other from the perspective of being consumer centric and
                  giving the consumer what they desired. This was especially
                  true for choosing to take or trash some of the card holding
                  benefits that were a shared cost burden between payment
                  networks and LES Bank. A cost value analysis study was carried
                  out using historic data of benefits used by customers and
                  through primary research: by speaking to card holders both
                  potential and current in order to overcome this decision
                  making hurdle.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Data of internal active users was also hard to come by
                  especially in a bank that is privy to customer’s confidential
                  information. Adhering to strict compliance in every request
                  for data from internal departments was a challenge. Reliance
                  was on primary research and directly speaking to customers to
                  substitute for data that was unavailable or could not be
                  shared.
