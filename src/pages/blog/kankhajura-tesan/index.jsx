              Content Marketing Strategy seems to be the talk of the town. Every
              company seems to be focused on leveraging the power of content to
              get free impressions.

            <div className="mtop-2">
              Product placements in trending OTT shows or with viral Youtube
              content creators are great examples of content marketing.

              Well, long before all this, a company championed content marketing

            </div>

            <div className="mtop-2">
              Kan Khajura Tesan is the answer. This was an incredible media and
              content innovation by Hindustan Unilever. Kan Khajura Tesan is an
              initiative which helped HUL crack a completely media dark
              territory like never before. But before we get into it, let us
              understand rural marketing first.
            </div>

            <div className="mtop-2">
              <h2>What is Rural Marketing?</h2>
            </div>

            <div className="mtop-2">
              Rural marketing is the process of marketing to consumers who live
              in rural areas. These consumers have different needs and pain
              points as compared to urban consumers. The tough part about rural
              advertising is to be able to communicate in technology devoid
              areas at a reasonable cost. The truth of our country is that a lot
              of growth potential lies trapped in Bharat- the rural India. As
              the quality of life of Bharat improves every decade, the brands
              that are able to make themselves memorable & relevant to the mass
              Indians will be the ones that will be able to unlock penetration
              numbers in upcoming categories: from body wash to laptops.
            </div>

            <div className="mtop-2">
              Hence Rural Marketing is a crucial puzzle to be solved.
            </div>

            <div className="mtop-2">
              Read more to understand how HUL solved this puzzle by creating Kan
              Khajura Tesan.
            </div>

            <div className="mtop-2">
              <h2>
                What was the Business Objective of HUL’s Rural Marketing
                Strategy with Kan Khajura Tesan?
              </h2>

              <div className="mtop-2">
                <h3>To reach media-dark parts of the country</h3>
              </div>

              <div className="mtop-2">
                For unlocking growth, it is imperative for FMCG giants to take
                their brand communication to the rural customer base but in
                absence of traditional media options, this has proved to be a
                challenge.
              </div>

              <div className="mtop-2">
                The objective for HUL was to penetrate into the Tier 4 and Tier
                5 towns through a rural content marketing strategy. But the
                challenges that needed to be addressed were -

                  <li>
                    <h4>How to make the content always on?</h4>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <h4>

                  <li>
                    <h4>How do the users access the content on-demand?</h4>

                  <li>
                    <h4>How do we make it free?</h4>
                  </li>
                </ol>
              </div>

              <div className="mtop-2">
                These are the villages that cannot be reached using traditional
                media like Television, radio or print, but where at least one
                member in the household owned a cell phone.
              </div>

                  How to make the content marketing strategy work for the brand

                </h2>
              </div>

              <div className="mtop-2">
                Just like any other marketing initiative, a principle of rural
                marketing is to understand the tension, the triggers and the
                barriers of the rural consumer.
              </div>

              <div className="mtop-2">
                A clear insight was that for this target group, there is no way
                that you can charge them for the content as they suspect
                everything because they have always burnt their fingers with
                various sorts of schemes. So the strategy was to make the
                content free and the only way to convince them that it is free
                is that the way for them to demand this content should be
                through a missed call. That was the core insight of this content
                marketing strategy.
              </div>

              <div className="mtop-2">
                The consumers had to give a missed call to the Kan Khajura Tesan
                number and they would receive a call back which would give the
                users access to entertainment.
              </div>

              <div className="mtop-2">

                <div className="mtop-2">
                  Since the company owns the content, they could integrate this
                  with brand messaging very well and figure out the best ways to
                  make it work. The consumers could access 20 minutes of updated
                  content which would be updated on a weekly basis. The content
                  marketing strategy was to divide the content into 17 minutes
                  of entertainment and 3 minutes of HUL advertisement.

                <h2>The Rural Marketing Campaign Activation</h2>

                <div className="mtop-2">
                  For the initial numbers, HUL promoted the Kan Khajura Tesan
                  number by putting up posters, banners and event flyers at
                  places where people gathered – Railway Station, Local Cattle
                  fares, Gas Station, and Mobile Recharge outlets etc.
                </div>

                <div className="mtop-2">
                  They also made targeted outbound calls. Their content
                  marketing strategy involved tying up with the latest movie
                  releases, regional content, popular radio jockey to ensure
                  that people kept calling the Kan Khajura Tesan number
                  regularly.
                </div>

                <div className="mtop-2">
                  They also started building feedback loops into this and this
                  response was helpful while coming out with mass media
                  campaigns. The Kan Khajura Tesan campaign has been going on
                  for the last 5 years and remains the pioneer example of
                  creating a Rural Content Marketing Strategy.

                  strategy and execution of the Kan Khajura Tesan campaign which
                  was a success not just from a reach standpoint but the overall
