              William Procter and James Gamble would never have crossed paths if
              they hadn’t married the sisters, Olivia and Elizabeth Norris. For
              a company that leaves almost nothing to chance, this fortuitous
              beginning is almost ironic.

              P&G has been around for 178 years. It was founded full two decades
              before the famous and oh-so-distant Mangal Pandey led ‘Revolt of
              1857’. Its legacy is such that the world literally discovered
              things as P&G invented them.
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              It was the first company in the world to conduct data-based market
              research with consumers, the first to advertise directly to
              consumers on TV and one of the first to establish a consumer
              relations department.
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              Today its market capitalization is more than the GDP of many
              countries. In the hyper-dynamic world of startups, acquisitions
              and high attrition rates, P&G is akin to the calm, experienced
              marathon runner who is confident of outrunning the young sprinters
              on the long road.
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              It is this steady persona that explains why P&G deliberately
              treads so carefully when it comes to getting new talent on-board.
              To give you some perspective:

                  It hires less than 1% of the 1 million applications that it
                  receives every year globally.
                </li>
                <li>
                  It prefers to hire people at the entry level as it believes in
                  creating leaders who are “Built from within”. Your best chance
                  to get in is through the campus placement route.

                  It has literally been the pioneer in setting best practices
                  for recruitment processes. P&G was one of the first companies
                  in the world to develop & patent an adaptable reasoning test.

                <li className="mtop-1">
                  P&G hires the person, not the position. The focus of the
                  assessments prior to the interviews is to confirm that you
                  have the threshold reasoning skills and that you are a culture
                  fit. The interviews are competency based, specifically focused
                  on understanding who you really are rather than your technical
                  skills.
                </li>

            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              Now let us get to the ideal candidate that P&G is looking for! P&G
              recruits and evaluates its people against core competencies called
              “success drivers”. The company’s purpose, values and principles
              (PVP) are at the core of this model. We’ll start by understanding
              the three Success Drivers.
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              <h3>Power of Minds:</h3>
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              The ability to draw insights from various sources of information,
              leverage data to make decisions, and identify opportunities for
              improvement.
            </div>
            <div>
              The fundamental philosophy behind Power of Minds is that data
              collection and analysis are essential to attaining a lasting
              competitive edge. P&G expects its employees to always strive for
              knowledge mastery: be the information kings of their respective
              categories/businesses and follow a sequential decision-making
              process based on that data.
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              “In God we trust, everyone else brings data to the table” might
              have been uttered by Narayana Murthy but fits perfectly to P&G. In
              fact, P&G has its own version of this:
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              “Data always wins. If there is no data, people with the highest
              salary win.”
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              The dictum is clear, if you have data, you can challenge anyone.
              In case there is no data, the experienced guy will be listened to.
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              <h3>Power of People:</h3>
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              Leadership, collaboration, and development of self and others.
              Power of People creates a working environment where everyone feels
              free to contribute their best and keep their minds open to new
              ideas. The regard for collaborative working is high. Also P&G
              wants its leaders to nurture and grow the people below. This is
              crucial since all its leaders are “Built from Within”.

              ‘If you leave us our money, our buildings, and our brands, but
              take away our people, the Company will fail. But if you take away

              we can rebuild the whole thing in a decade.’

              <h3>Power of Agility:</h3>
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              The ability to be responsive and in-tune with one’s environment,
              and the discipline to focus your efforts on top priorities.
            </div>
            <div>
              Long before VUCA became a buzzword, P&G had it figured that
              business solutions are neither easy nor straightforward. There are
              too much change, complexity and too many different parameters
              affecting the same problem. P&G believes that it can win only when
              its employees are tuned into the world around them and look at the
              problem from all perspectives. That happens when they truly
              understand their customers, consumers, stakeholders, competitors,
              and employees. The Power of Agility further states that the
              employees need to quickly apply all this knowledge to their
              business decisions and that requires prioritizing & being
              disciplined with the decision making processes.
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              In a nutshell, you can only be accurate if you are exhaustive, you
              can only afford to be exhaustive if you are fast, and you can only
              be fast if you are disciplined.

            <div className="mtop-2">
              During the entire recruitment process, P&G looks for how you
              relate to, compare with and connect to the above-mentioned Success
              Drivers. Having talked to a number of recruiters and candidates,
              we have zeroed in on the following behavioral attributes that fit
              well with the above success drivers.

            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              As already mentioned, at P&G data is your sword and your morning
              coffee. Intuition or emotions play no part when it comes to the
              decision-making process and nothing is left to chance. An
              analytical mind that uses data to come to conclusions is
              preferred.

              At P&G, mutual interdependency is a way of life. Believing that
              together everyone achieves more is the key to being a team player.
              P&G doesn’t appreciate individuals who prefer to wage solo
              battles. People with a good Emotional Quotient (EQ) are sought out
              as collaborating and mentoring are key to the nurturing
              environment of P&G.

              Apart from these success drivers, PVP: Purpose, Values, and
              Principles, are core to P&G’s philosophy. Check them out in detail
              here. To test candidates on how they align with P&G’s PVP,
              questions like the following can be asked:

                  Leadership and ethics are inevitably intertwined in the
                  business world. Describe a situation in which you have dealt
                  with these issues and how they have influenced you.

                  What is your greatest achievement in life thus far?

              As you would have realized by now, the P&G process forces you to
              take a hard look within. They diligently look for consistency and
              coherence in your answers, be it the psychographic test or the
              multiple rounds of interviews. Hence, you cannot afford to pretend
              to be someone else. Our advice: introspect thoroughly before this
              interview and understand how your past decisions and behaviours
              align with the success drivers. If you think you are the type of
              person who would blossom in a data-driven, process-oriented
              company with extreme focus on collaborative team play, we reckon
              P&G is the dream company you’ve been looking for. From personal
              experiences of friends and colleagues, we know that once you
              become one of them, they go out of their way to take care of you.
