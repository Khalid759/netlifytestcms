              Summer Internships have finally concluded in B-Schools across the
              country. However, in just a few months, the atmosphere across
              campuses shall become tense again as the final placements
              approach. While the final placements can be a stressful period for
              even those with the ‘perfect’ CV, others might have to face a
              different set of challenges. You might have dreamed of building a
              career in marketing but landing a dream sales and marketing job is
              contingent upon several factors and not all of them are in your
              direct control.
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              Take Surabhi Tripathi for instance, a 2014 pass out from IIM
              Kozhikode. Surabhi had a prior experience of 40 months in an IT
              major. She had entered the MBA program with the intention of
              building a career in marketing. However, after getting repeatedly
              short-listed for IT roles and being overlooked for S&M ones during
              her summers, she realized that her CV would require a substantial
              rework to bag a final placement in a sales and marketing role.
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              Or take the case of Sujoy, a 2014 pass out from FMS, Delhi, who
              after his under-graduation in Economics from St. Xavier’s College,
              ended up interning at a finance firm during summers. It was only
              towards the end of his internship that he realized that he
              actually wanted to build a career in sales and marketing. However,
              with such a finance-heavy profile, how does one make the switch?
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              And these are just two cases. In B-Schools across India, there are
              candidates who are eager to build their career in sales and
              marketing but don’t have the background or the CV suitable for it.
              Surabhi and Sujoy today are successful marketing professionals in
              prestigious companies. While Sujoy presently works at HUL in the
              homecare division, Surabhi works with the market research team at
              ITC. Their stories highlight how they overcame their challenges to
              build a career they wanted and how you could do the same.
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              Several interesting insights emerge out of their stories. “The key
              is to make your CV more marketing oriented by filling the gaps.
              There will always be things like your prior work experience and
              grades that you can’t change. However, apart from these two
              sections, the rest is in your hands” – says Surabhi. Not having
              enough marketing related points on her CV and having work
              experience in IT domain, Surabhi went about in a structured manner
              to reframe her CV by recognizing four areas she could work on –
              Projects, Case Study Competitions, Roles and Responsibilities, and
              Courses and Certifications. She then systematically scouted for
              marketing projects and courses she could take to strengthen her
              credentials in addition to successfully competing in several case
              study competitions.
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              Sujoy, on the other hand, did not have work experience but being
              from an economics background, he always thought he was destined
              for a finance career. Though he was fascinated by marketing and
              eagerly attended the guest lectures, but did not think of it as a
              career. In fact, even his summer internship was in a finance role.
              However, towards the end of his internship, he began to realize
              that he didn’t really enjoy the finance role as much as he thought
              he would. After reaching out to several alumni of his college and
              looking at their career progression, he finally made a decision to
              switch over to marketing.
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              There was, however, one problem – his CV screamed finance. How was
              he to convince the recruiters that although he under graduated in
              economics and did his summers at a finance firm, he would do well
              in a marketing career? Sujoy identified three major stumbling
              blocks in his way to a marketing career – getting shortlists for
              S&M roles with a finance heavy CV, intense competition from peers
              with almost half the batch having Marketing as a major, and the
              lack of sufficient subject knowledge. Sujoy focussed on case study
              competitions to bolster his marketing credentials while
              simultaneously investing a lot of time and effort in bridging the
              knowledge gap with his classmates.
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              Some common themes emerge as we analyse these stories. Firstly,
              the paramount importance of case study competitions in building
              credibility. Recruiters know the amount of time, effort and skill
              it takes to crack a national level competition. Doing well here is
              a very strong signal as to your seriousness and passion towards
              marketing as a career option. In fact, companies have started
              looking at case study competitions as a recruitment channel with a
              high ROI. Spend a few lakh rupees and you’ll have the cream of top
              B-Schools across the country working hard to come up with
              solutions to real-world business problems. HUL Lime, RB Mavericks,
              and ITC Interrobang are a few competitions that give you the
              opportunity of a direct PPI or a PPO.
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              Surabhi has a piece of sobering advice here though – “Don’t
              participate in every competition that comes your way. Focus on
              just a few and aim to crack them. Often people spread their
              efforts too thin and get frustrated with poor results”. Very
              often, winning case study competitions may not help you in getting
              shortlists but they definitely provide a lot to talk about in your
              personal interviews.
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              Marketing courses and workshops are also a great way to not only
              improve your knowledge of the subject matter but add CV points
              that may drive your personal interviews. Apart from the standard
              Google certifications for Analytics and Adwords, try to complete
              Hubspot courses for content and inbound marketing as well. Unlike
              Finance and Operations where industry standard certifications like
              CFA and Six-Sigma are available, marketing didn’t have a parallel
              certification. Kraftshala’s IndustryCredsTM certifications in

              measuring the students’ marketing and sales acumen.
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              Your aim as you prepare for placements should not be only getting
              many shortlists but being confident of cracking any opportunity
              that comes your way. Here, nothing can help you but an in-depth
              understanding of the subject. ‘Read as much as possible’ was the
              mantra Sujoy followed. Read from your textbooks, sites like
              afaqs.com and adage.com, case studies, and any and everything you
              can find. If you are really made for marketing, this would not
              seem like an effort at all. Working on short-term projects is also
              a great way of bolstering the practical aspects of your knowledge
              and a good CV point as well.
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              To conclude, evaluate your strengths and weaknesses carefully and
              go about filling the gaps in your CV in a systematic manner.
              Remember that bit about signalling from Microeconomics class? A
              good brand and profile in summers is indeed a positive signal
              about your S&M skills, but there are multiple other ways to send
              that signal as well. Now it’s up to you to find your own way.
