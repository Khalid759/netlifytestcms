            </div>
            <div>
              Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic
              inflammatory lung disease that causes obstructed airflow from the
              lungs. It is majorly caused due to life style problems such as
              chronic exposure to toxins in the air for long periods of time.
              Women in rural areas who cook food over a traditional ‘chula’ and
              chemical factory/mine workers are often victims of the disease.
              Chain cigarette smokers make up a minority of the populace
              affected by the disease. Cipla’s drug TIOVA taken through a
              respiratory inhaler is a preventive and curative solution to COPS.
              However, sales of the drug have been low and stagnant in spite of
              over 30 Mn COPD patients in India. Ripla, being the market leader
              in respiratory related drugs seeks a solution to this issue
              through extensive market research of the main causes of low usage
              and sales.

                  The first phase of the project consisted of theoretically
                  understanding the COPD disease, TIOVA as a drug. This was done
                  by studying information packets provided by RIPLA and also
                  secondary research of medical journals and blogs. The present
                  market scenario of COPD battling drugs was studied, and it was
                  found that lower usage of drugs and low sales was not just a
                  RIPLA specific issue but an industry wide issue. This
                  conclusion was drawn from interacting with the sales team and
                  researching drug sales databases.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The sales channel of Pharma as a sector was studied by
                  shadowing an MR (Medical Representative) on their territory
                  assigned visits to doctors. The sales pitch of MRs was closely
                  studied on 3 days of field visits in the Mumbai geography.
                  Each day of the field visit consisted of meeting 8-10 doctors
                  and pitching RIPLA drugs to them. The average time spent with
                  each doctor was 2-3 minutes and sometimes a 20 second pitch
                  was all that was entertained by busy doctors.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In the next phase of the project a questionnaire for doctors
                  was designed to understand the cause of low prescriptions of
                  TIOVA. This survey was designed in collaboration with the
                  internal medical teams as well as the marketing department to
                  bridge the gap between scientific data to gain managerial
                  insights. The survey consisted of MCQ as well as open ended
                  questions about COPD patients, their behavior and doctors’
                  recommendations to them.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Since the research had to be carried out on a large scale,
                  before floating the extensive survey, a pre-research survey
                  was also designed in order to test whether the results
                  obtained would generate valid insights. This pre-research
                  survey was floated locally to 30 doctors.
                </li>
                <li>
                  On analysing the pre-research survey results, it was found
                  that no particular trend/reason could be established for the
                  reason of low prescriptions. A hypothesis was formed that the
                  doctors had not carefully answered the questions as per their
                  best judgements. Basis this hypothesis, the main research
                  survey was redesigned to incorporate similar questions
                  occurring at regular intervals phrased in different ways,
                  similar to a psychometric test.
                </li>
                <li>
                  On floating the extensive research survey to 400+ doctors,
                  those survey forms with consistent responses on similar
                  questions were accepted to be valid responses and the others
                  were rejected as invalid. The research was carried out across
                  8 cities in the states of Maharashtra, Telengana, UP and Delhi
                  with the assistance of an external market research agency.

                <li>
                  On analysing the survey data obtained through excel and also
                  interacting personally with more than 50 doctors 3 key reasons
                  were establish for low TIOVA prescription and usage.

                    The symptoms of COPD are similar to that of Asthama. Hence,
                    COPD is often confused with Asthama which has more awareness
                    in the medical community and the general populace. To
                    differentiate COPD from Asthama, a spirometer device is
                    required for diagnosis which is capital intensive and not
                    present in small doctors’ clinics. In the past, micro
                    spirometers were developed by CIPLA and distributed free of
                    cost to doctors as part of a pilot project, which too failed
                    promoting usage by doctors.

                    A pain point for doctors recognized from the survey, was the
                    long time it took for diagnosis using a spirometer. A
                    suggestion to combat this pain point was training MRs to
                    carry out the diagnosis at the doctors’ site. This solution
                    was not scalable as determined by a pilot. This was due to
                    uneven MR resource allocation, which could not be optimized.
                    The most feasible and scalable option was to outsource
                    diagnosis and partner with diagnostic centers. The
                    partnership of CIPLA with 2 leading diagnostic centers was
                    being worked upon towards the end of the internship.

                    Doctors initially prescribe Asthma medicines to COPD
                    patients which contain a steroid component that provides
                    temporary relief to patients but is not a long term
                    solution. Patients do not re-visit the doctor and keep
                    buying the Asthama medicine in irregular doses to get
                    momentary relief. This is harmful for long term well-being.

                    Changing the line of communication by MRs about TIOVA to
                    doctors. The 1st line of communication requires initial
                    screening and proper pinpointing of disease through
                    diagnosis followed by prescription recommendation. TIOVA was
                    recommended only to COPD patients who returned to doctors
                    when Asthama medicines failed them. With the 1st line of
                    communication doctors would prescribe TIOVA to all patients
                    who are tested positive for COPD from the get-go, without
                    requiring a revisit by the patient.

                    Affordability of the medicine was a key issue. COPD can be
                    termed as a ‘poor person’s disease’ since it is caused by
                    long term exposure to toxic that can be attributed to
                    lifestyle. A chronic COPD patient had to take a dose of
                    TIOVA every day and this inhibited people from purchasing
                    the medicine.

                    Bundle pricing inspired from the FMCG sector was suggested.
                    Monthly packs for the medicine could be sold cheaper than
                    daily doses. The pricing revamp on larger packs that could
                    break bulk was suggested to the finance team.

                  Since the project was primarily market research based, the key
                  challenges was seeking doctors to interview in order to get to
                  the root cause of low prescription numbers. Doctors are busy
                  people saving lives and it was expected that they would not
                  have time to answer questions of an intern. Waiting outside
                  doctors’ cabins for 2-3 hours was common as was being turned
                  away by some. Patience and persistence were the two qualities
                  that came in handy to battle this challenge. Instead of
                  directly jumping to the topic of TIOVA and its low
                  prescriptions, doctors were first asked about their views on
                  COPD in general and the research was framed more like a
                  conversation and dialogue than a question and answer format.
                  Doctors were addressed not from the perspective of a student
                  conducting research for an internship but as an employee of
                  RIPLA.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Another challenge was training the MRs on the new line of
                  communication to be used while introducing TIOVA to doctors.
                  MRs had to unlearn what they already knew in the form of their
                  sales pitch and had to relearn a new pitch. Building
                  relationships with them and involving them in the project not
                  just as front line salespeople but as relevant stakeholders
                  whose opinions mattered, helped in this regard.
