              So what explains this difference in box office returns?
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              <ul className="bullet-points">
                <li>Did the audience expectations change?</li>
                <li>
                  Was it a change in the audience composition? (with new,
                  lower-middle class audiences entering)
                </li>
                <li>
                  Did it have something to do with actors’ choice of movies?
                </li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              There’s probably an element of truth in all of these statements.
              And that’s an issue for not just film stars but every brand that
              has an ambition to be successful over decades. How can you plan
              for success when audience expectations, composition and sometimes
              even your products are going to be radically different than what
              they are today?
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              The answer isn’t found by getting good at prediction, but
              ironically the reverse. If you can isolate something in your brand
              that’s unique but also speaks to an unchanging consumer need, you
              have found the secret pathway through which all iconic brands are
              formed.
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">So what then is Brand Essence?</div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              Brand Essence is simply the DNA of the brand. It is at the heart
              of everything that the brand says and does. It is the constant
              that gets replicated across products, categories, geographies and
              decades.
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              It is the first thing that someone might say to quickly describe
              the brand in an elevator conversation. For Example: Dettol is all
              about protection, Disney is all about a Magical World etc.
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">So how do you create a Brand Essence?</div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              We have simplified this as a 6 Step Framework called the Brand
              DNA.

              Let’s look at the 6 steps for the Brand DNA for Dove:
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              <ol className="bullet-points">
                <li>
                  <b>SuperConsumer:</b> Whose life does my brand aim to enhance?
                  For Dove, the super consumer would be: “24- 39 year old women
                  who hate pretentiousness and value natural, healthy beauty. An
                  age that is beyond the point of being extremely concerned with
                  Acne & too young to be excessively worried about wrinkles.”
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Tension:</b> What is the deep seated thing in the
                  consumer’s psyche that the brand wants to address? For Dove,
                  the tension could look something like: “Sometimes the pressure
                  to live up to beauty standards can be too much.”
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Trend:</b> What is the cultural trend that is either
                  causing the tension or is happening because of the tension?
                  For Dove, the trend is around: “The unrealistic standards of
                  beauty set by celebrities, influencers, IG filters etc makes
                  feeling beautiful unachievable.”
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Ladder:</b> The Ladder captures how your brand’s product
                  attributes and RTB layer up to functional and then emotional
                  benefit. In case of Dove, the Ladder looks like:
                </li>

                  />
                </div>
                <li className="mtop-2">
                  <b>Personality:</b> What kind of person would my brand be?
                  What personality traits show how my brand thinks, behaves and
                  even talks differently from others ? For Dove, the personality
                  is close to being: “Transparent, confident, and inspiring.”
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Purpose:</b> Why does my brand get up everyday? How will
                  the brand overturn the Trend around so as to resolve the
                  Tension?
                </li>
              </ol>
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              Summarizing this, the essence for Dove becomes: “Dove is all about
              confidence of real beauty”

            <div className="mtop-2 mtop-2">
              Which brings us back to the Khans

            <div className="mtop-2">
              Like all new brands struggling to achieve a product market fit, in
              the initial years, Aamir did the full range of movies, largely
              doing whatever work he could get.
            </div>
            <div className="blog-hero-img mtop-2">

            <div className="mtop-2">
              It was only in 2001 with the breakout success of Lagaan and Dil
              Chahta Hai that his Brand Essence became clear, both for himself
              and his audience.
            </div>

              />
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              Let’s examine the Brand DNA for Amir Khan:
            </div>
            <div className="blog-hero-img">
              <StaticImage
                src="https://kfwebassets.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/blog/brand_essence/Frame-7-1.webp"
                alt="Amir Khan"
                title="Amir Khan"
                placeholder="none"
              />
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              The essence for Amir Khan thus was: “All about fresh,
              experimentative cinema”
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              Post 2001, Aamir stayed true to his Essence, becoming highly
              selective with his choice of movies even as Shah Rukh reigned
              supreme between 2000-2008. That discipline and sacrifice, while
              being detrimental in short term revenues, was the key to his
              spectacular success of the following decade.
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              In contrast, SRK found his Brand Essence 6 years earlier than
              Aamir with the success of DDLJ, which led to his rise to the top
              through movies that built on his essence of being a Romantic
              Dreamseller. Incidentally, Shah Rukh himself probably recognized
              that truth, which is why he named his new production company
              Dreamz Unlimited back in 1997.
            </div>
            <div className="blog-hero-img">
              <StaticImage
                src="https://kfwebassets.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/blog/brand_essence/Frame-10.webp"
                alt="Amir Khan"
                title="Amir Khan"
                placeholder="none"
              />
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              Unfortunately for him, there are only so many stories that one can
              tell as a Romantic Dreamseller. This forced him to experiment
              widely with his choice of movies, creating a dissonance with his
              core audience. Bit by bit, he lost his magic at the box office.
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              To summarize, you need to choose a Brand essence that is unique,
              captures your relationship with the audience and speaks to a
              consumer’s needs will be relevant for decades. As the Covid-19
              crisis creates new opportunities, it will be interesting to see
              how brands adapt to this new reality in their consumer’s life
              without giving up on what makes them distinctive and loved.
