                Dream 11, Uber & Airbnb - These companies identified
                opportunities, and as first movers, were the key companies to
                build categories. But competition for all these players soon
                followed. Ex: Ola, Jugnoo, Blue Taxi, etc., competed with Uber;
                similarly, MPL, Halaplay, My 11 play, etc., competed with Dream
                11 and likewise.

                On the other hand, players like Nike, Adidas, Reebok were the
                only known (& accepted) players in the sports apparels category
                for decades. However, in recent years, many brands have entered
                the Indian market, such as Asics, New Balance, Under Armour,
                Skechers, etc., in hopes of finding their niche.

                Essentially, new brands with newer branding strategies and big

                hyperactive digital world ecosystem is through forging
                meaningful brand collaborations to tap into the interconnected

                To understand how we can pursue meaningful Brand Collaborations
                (Co-Branding) and partnerships that can help us unlock success,
                we need to be definitive about linking it to our marketing
                objective.
              </div>
              <div className="mtop-2">
                As we all know, it is quintessential to link all your marketing
                efforts with your overall marketing objective. That should be
                the goal behind building brand collaborations too. We need to
                ensure that your brand & marketing collaboration contributes to
                a more central and critical brand objective.
              </div>
              <div className="mtop-2">
                However, we also know that the marketing objectives are
                dependent on the business’s needs and goals. As such, different
                organizations can have different goals based on various factors.
                Therefore, to unify the process well (and share
                recommendations), we will take the marketing funnel as the
                starting point for our understanding. We will understand the
                different marketing objectives and leverage them to create
                successful brand collaborations (Co-Branding) using the
                marketing funnel.

                      for you, and thus can qualify as ‘new reach’.

                  As most of us know that owning the category drivers is very

                  alleviate the barriers for usage too (ex - travel during covid
                  & safety). However, given that most of the consumption
                  audience today is Gen-Z and Millennials, winning user’s
                  confidence is not as easy.

                      partner is a user of your product or service, it
                      communicates a message more deeply than another promise
                      that any other brand makes. Therefore, your biggest RTB is
                      a known consumer. Ex:{" "}

                </div>

                <div>
                  Brands do not always want to build their existence on
                  price-offs and discounts, but they still need to drive trials
                  by incentivizing the new users. A good way is to form an
                  alliance with partners who can effectively incentivize your
                  users.
                </div>

                <div className="mtop-2">Here is how to do it well:</div>

                        Tap into cross-selling opportunity into a closely
                        connected category:
                      </h5>{" "}
                      Make an alliance with a partner that operates in a closely
                      connected category. That has the strength to speak to
                      users with high intent of purchase from your category.
                    </div>
                    <div className="mtop-1">
                      Ex: Mobile - Accessories, Flights - Taxis & Accommodation.
                      This creates an opportunity for cross-selling with a
                      partner’s proposition that also adds incentive for the
                      user.
                    </div>

                  <li className="mtop-1">
                    <h5 className="d-inline">Go exclusive:</h5> Look at
                    time-bound exclusivity with partners to get a reach/effort
                    guarantee from your partner. It is because the partners also
                    benefit if this value is provided exclusively to their
                    user-base and would thus push the proposition/spend on the
                    reach out to their existing users.

                <h4>2. Provide incremental Value:</h4>
              </div>
              <div>
                The definition of a value seeker has changed now. It is not
                about finding a product that offers only value for money, but
                about getting a product that you think provides a good
                experience at a reasonable price and from a trusted source. Here
                are a couple of ways to create incremental value beyond monetary
                savings for your consumers:
              </div>
              <ul className="bullet-points">
                <li className="mtop-1">
                  <h5>Provide more value add through partner’s benefit:</h5>{" "}
                  This can work for you if you are a brand in a cluttered
                  category and have a good reach. Partners looking for
                  visibility can partner with you and offer more value to your
                  consumers. Ex: PepsiCo - MMT.
                </li>
                <li className="mtop-1">
                  <h5>Value beyond the product:</h5> Understand where all your
                  users can find value in your brand over your competitors. Ex:
                  Being socially aware can help them get a better-perceived
                  value from your brand. If so, partner with organizations /
                  NGOs that can help you contribute positively to society. Ex:{" "}

                  Create an ecosystem of alliances that make it extremely simple
                  to find access to your product. Ex: Preloaded apps on the
                  phone.

                  Create a super-strong proposition for the users of your allied
                  partners- so that they use your brand when they transact with
                  your allies. That is usually a slightly forced way of driving
                  consumer acceptance and thus product trial; therefore, it may
                  not be preferred by some brands and alliance partners. Ex:
                  Paytm – Uber. Paytm was the only digital payment option for
                  Uber users.

                  Collaborations have been widely used to drive consumer
                  loyalty, especially in the aviation + hospitality and the
                  banking industry. This is driven from the PoV that the
                  benefits that your consumer can derive for being loyal to your
                  brand must go beyond the incremental benefits from your brand
                  itself. However, the key differentiator to establish through

                    the best associations created to drive consumer loyalty are
                    the ones that have been created for providing a longer-term
                    benefit. Thereby providing the comfort to the user to rely
                    on the benefit while continuing to return to your brand. Ex:
                    ICICI & Amazon. Normal discount terms v/s long-term value on
                    a platform of choice.

                    Partner with platforms that amplify your products usage and
                    are also wanted by your consumer. Ex: Airtel Thanks Bouquet

                    Experts drill down deeper to understand the root cause that
                    is causing the problem/barrier resulting. For example -
                    knowing that the brand has low consideration is not enough.
                    It is rather important to understand what exactly is causing

                  The reality is that even after you have identified the problem
                  and wish-listed the right partners, the key reason why some of
                  the best ideas cannot see the light of the day is due to
                  defining goals without shared benefits. The real struggle
                  starts when you need to define shared benefits - because this
                  process is seldom unilateral. This not only requires
                  understanding your partner’s needs and motivation better (much
                  like in a marriage) but also requires perseverance to drive
