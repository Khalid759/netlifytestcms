              We all dream of a resume that is like a conversion machine. A

              <h2>Why most CVs fail?</h2>
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-1">
              You are very likely to fail because the majority of resumes
              actually fail at this pursuit. While most people envision to serve
              the recruiter a spicy and delicious bowl of paani puri, a vast
              majority* of the resumes end up being like lukewarm water and fail
              on their objective.

              The Asterisk: How likely is it that your CV fails to get you an
              interview?Think about it. How many people do you think apply to
              dream recruiters like Google, Amazon, HUL etc? According to
              QZ.com, this number is 3 million for Google.
              <div className="mtop-1">
                Now how many of these resume applications do you think convert
                into an interview?
              </div>
              <div className="mtop-1">
                Let us do a back of the newspaper calculation.
              </div>
              <div className="mtop-1">
                We know that the number of hires google makes each year is
                around 7,000.
              </div>
              <div className="mtop-1">
                The rate of converting the interview process is expected to be
                somewhere between a very healthy 1 in 5, to something that will
                give the HR some sweat: 1 in 10. Let us take a middle lane 1 in
                7 for our guesstimate.
              </div>
              <div className="mtop-1">
                This means that for 3 million applicants, only 49,000 resumes
                actually get an interview.
              </div>
              <div className="mtop-1">
                This means that for a dream recruiter like Google,
                probabilistically 98.3% of the resumes fail to get even a step
                into the interview room.

            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              The first major reason for this is that most people spend too
              little time in creating their resume. Maybe a few hours before
              they have to submit. If you compare it to the amount of time
              successful MIT applicants spend on their resume, which is on the
              lines of a week to ten days, you can see why most people end up
              making a mediocre resume.
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              The second reason why you are most likely to not create an
              exceptional resume is that most of us start out on the wrong limb.
              Most people start out by searching for resume formats and
              ready-made CV builders that you can quickly fill up.
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              This is similar to trying to build up the 7th floor of your house
              without having the first 6 floors or the foundational basement.
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              Great resume formats are just the makeup that make your CV shine
              and glitter. It is certainly not something that will get the
              recruiter to put you through to the interview round.

                “See, a resume is actually a snapshot of an individual’s brand.
                You have to make it exciting enough to the recruiter to feel the
                need to meet you. That’s what the resume does. It acts as the
                first point of interaction with the hiring manager or with the
                recruiter, and, if that does not go well, it takes a lot of
                effort from the individual’s end to kind of convince the
                organisation that they’re fit for the role. So, it’s the first
                impression that matters. In most situations, this is what helps
                you make the first impression right.”

            <div className="mtop-2">
              You see how she equated the resume to a snapshot of a brand? What
              do you think it makes you?
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">Yes, YOU are the brand.</div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              And who is the recruiter? The recruiter is the consumer who is

            <div className="mtop-2">
              So, CV is an ad targeted to the recruiter. It’s not a summary of
              the person you are. Or, to rephrase, it’s not the summation of the
              person you think you are. The CV is not about you, it is about the
              recruiter – your potential boss, who is looking for a certain set
              of things.

              This means that the goal of the CV is not to present your entire
              profile, but to present those parts of you which are actually
              relevant to the job at hand. And not presented in a blank fashion,

                related to, I am given to understand, they’re all tech related
                projects that I can see. While you should necessarily mention a
                lot of good projects, which had high impact, high reach, a lot
                of value to the organisation you’ve been associated with
                earlier, you should mandatorily and necessarily highlight those
                achievements and accolades. But a lot of this information
                because the kind of profile you’re applying for is very very
                different than what you have done earlier. It’s not adding a lot
                to your professional calibre. Because, I am not really too
                concerned with how good an engineer you were before you decided
                to enrol yourself to an MBA course. For some organisations,
                that’ll be an added plus. For tech organisations, if you’ve got
                a tech background, prior to an MBA, obviously it’s an added
                plus. But for an organisation like mine, for example, I operate
                an FMCG domain. I don’t think much of these software
                achievements or awareness on a lot of these softwares will do
                much.”

              You see how she found a lot of information in this CV unrelated to
              the job. The applicant wasn’t focused on highlighting the benefits
              of these CV points to the recruiter, rather the applicant was just
              writing a summary of what they did. And that’s a huge problem.
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2 text-yellow">
              <h3>So what did we learn from this?</h3>
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              That you must always write the points such that they are presented
              as benefits to the recruiter. And not a summary of who you are of
              what you did!
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              What makes this point really interesting is that this is a mistake
              marketers often make too. So many times you would see
              advertisements harping on about product attributes, when they
              should really be focusing on the benefits that the user would get.
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              Snapdragon Processor is not a benefit. It is just a product
              attribute.
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              The benefit a user gets is speed & multitasking.
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              OnePlus 6 in its 2018 launch did not talk about the product
              attributes. They did benefit based marketing with the slogan ‘The
              Speed You Need’.
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">So should you!</div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              Now to really drive this point home, let us look at these CV
              points that have been written asa summary of things that the
              candidate did.
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              While they may be relevant for a Tech role, however are they
              really relevant when the candidate sends the same CV to apply to
              all other roles: sales, marketing, product, consulting, finance?
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              Nope, they are just ‘Blah’ when seen from the perspective of a lot
              of other roles. So on the right side we have reframed them in a
              way that makes so much more sense for a Sales & Marketing
              recruiter.
