              , we recently made an offer to a talented young professional who
              had graduated from a top business school earlier this year but was
              not entirely pleased with the job she ended up with. She
              eventually did not take up the role we offered, in part because of
              the compensation. Our offer was about 15% lesser than what she was
              making in her current role, if one compared the cash component
              only (there was substantial equity in our offer over and above
              that). I found something off in her conclusion on compensation,
              although at that moment I couldn’t quite put it down. I have since
              been able to better identify my concern.
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              Most people, but especially campus students, tend to think of
              compensation in immediate terms. It goes something like this:
            </div>

            <div className="mtop-2">
              <b>
                Compensation of a Job Offer = Money Earned in the coming year
              </b>
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              A more thoughtful analysis would reveal that compensation is
              better understood in terms of the time required, and hence capture
              compensation in terms of <b>Return on Time Invested (ROTI):</b>
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              <b>
                Compensation (ROTI) = Money Earned in the coming year/ Time
                demanded by the job
              </b>
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              But that’s where the analysis typically stops.
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              The problem with that formula is that it only accounts for
              short-term returns. If money really mattered to you, you would
              want to consider not just the money you will earn in the coming
              year but also how the actual effort you put in will contribute to
              your long-term career earnings. And since compensation, over a
              period of time, is a function of your skill and network
              (relationships)*, a better way to measure real compensation is:
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              <b>
                Real Compensation = (Money earned + Skill developed + Networks
                built)/ Time demanded by the job
              </b>
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              This means that each minute that you spend in a job doing
              mechanical, repetitive tasks in a bureaucratic setup instead of
              working in a job that develops your expertise, creativity and
              leadership skills, and better still, exposes you to other smart
              and ambitious people, has a substantial cost associated with it
              (beyond the obvious one that the former is boring and
              dispiriting). The fact that you can’t put a number to attributes
              like skill development and network building do not make them any
              less real, or significant. On the contrary, they offer an
              opportunity for disproportionate returns precisely because they
              are so often ignored.**
            </div>
            <div className="quote-div mtop-2">
              <blockquote>
                It’s a mistake that’s quite common on business schools campuses
                in particular. A trap that perhaps deserves its own name due to
                its sheer pervasiveness. The Immediate Compensation Trap can be
                defined as the tendency to focus on stated money only while
                evaluating the compensation of a job offer, disregarding the
                skill and network building benefits that contribute to long-term
                career earnings.
              </blockquote>
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              Of course, the Trap affects not just current students and recent
              alumni but older professionals as well. But its’ impact on younger
              people is more severe because developing skills and networks early
              helps you reap their benefits for many more years. The cumulative
              loss for younger professionals is substantially more.
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              Sometimes, smart and ambitious job seekers do see the Trap but are
              unable to resist falling for it nevertheless due to an entirely
              different reason. Ambitious people are the ones most susceptible
              to the allure of competing and winning. Compensation for the
              ambitious is often about keeping score and not just about building
              a better lifestyle. The higher the Immediate Compensation of a
              job, the greater the number of people it attracts, the more
              desirable it becomes. I certainly fell for the Trap on campus (I
              have since realised that my viewing of a career as a competitive
              race was likely an even bigger growth inhibitor, but that’s a
              topic for another time).

              The young professional in question currently has a job with a PSU.
              Working for a government entity can have many benefits- job
              security being the most obvious one, especially when compared to
              an early stage company. But in terms of Real Compensation, the
              offers did not come close. ***

              *Luck is also a factor (represented through unforeseen market
              forces). But if we know anything about the future, it is that the
              emerging knowledge economy is likely to accentuate the value of
              creativity, deep expertise, leadership skills and networks, since
              automation will take care of the mechanical, repetitive work.

              **Of course, a job is about more than just compensation. Research
              suggests that for people earning above a certain threshold,
              additional income leads to no increase in happiness. Finding
              meaning in work does.

              ***Some people argue that taking a salary cut requires a risk
              appetite that only a few people possess. On the contrary, in cases
              such as these, a much greater risk is of being less employable in
              a few years leading to restricted opportunities. My guess is that
              our hesitation stems from our tendency to worry about what our
              friends/ family/ colleagues will think. Sam Altman put it well:
              “Most people want to be accepted, so they won’t take risks that
              could make them look crazy, which actually makes them wildly
              miscalculate risk.”{" "}
