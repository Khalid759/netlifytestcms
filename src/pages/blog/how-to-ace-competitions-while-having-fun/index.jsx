              It is that time of the year when B-schools are buzzing with a lot
              of activities and the brightest minds of the country are pulling
              sleepless all-nighters to think of the next big ideas to solve
              business Case Studies. Many enthusiastic students have reached out
              to me to share some learnings of case studies from my experience
              as a participant, so here is an attempt to put together all the
              things that seem to have worked for my team and me üôÇ
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              It pays off to be structured and detailed right from the start and
              to illustrate this point, here is a step-by-step guide to solving
              the seemingly tough but absolutely rewarding case study
              challenges.
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2 text-blue">
              Step 1- Team formation for future transformation.
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              This is a very critical determinant of the outcome of all your
              future efforts. A good team is well begun and effectively quarter
              done. When I say good team, it essentially means a group of
              individuals who are equally passionate and driven to work, have
              complimentary skillsets, and most importantly they must agree to
              disagree on various work related aspects without adversely
              affecting their personal equation.
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              For instance, our team comprised of a meticulous in-house
              Consultant who kept us on track, the Finance whizkid on campus to
              keep us & our budgets under check and I, the self-proclaimed
              Marketeer to whip out creative solutions. Diversity helped us in
              more ways than one and I would strongly recommend to avoid the
              trap of having people from just Marketing or just Consulting
              background because it is a ‚ÄúBusiness Case Competition‚Äù and a
              winning organisation always has people from all spaces.
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2 text-blue">
              Step 2- Ask yourself What (?) is the problem that the case is
              talking about before jumping to How (?) can we best solve this
              problem.
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              Start with identifying what is the real objective behind the case
              study. Is it increasing customer engagement? Is it increasing
              sales of a recently launched product which was met with a lukewarm
              response? Once you get the hang of it, try to drill down to the
              root of the problem without getting perturbed by the symptoms
              which are merely the side effects.
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2 text-blue">
              Step 3- Explore your category.
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              Start by exploring the market- the sales volumes, the demand
              potential, the market players, the innovative practices being
              adopted, etc.
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              Primary research done by means of industry reports, white papers,
              news articles should just be the starting point of your
              exploration. Go deep or go home! If it is a case on Automobiles,
              go visit your nearby dealer showrooms; if it is a case on QSRs
              then visit similar outlets or mine insights from reviews on
              Zomato. Basically, find ways to make the most of the resources
              available.
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2 text-blue">
              Step 4- Know your TG (Target Group) at the back of your hand.
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              Your TG is the heart and soul of all your marketing efforts and
              everything that is to be done has to be done keeping them in mind.
              Who is your TG? Where do they shop? How much do they earn? What
              makes them buy products in this category? What are their media
              consumption habits? Basically find out who they are and what do
              they need and then give it to them in such a way that there is a
              new value for them.
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              To reach your TG, fall back on your network‚Äì if TG is Working
              Mothers then try reaching out to the ones in your family; if the
              TG is Car Owners of a particular brand then connect with your
              friends‚Äô parents who drive them.
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2 text-blue">
              Step 5- Identify the pain points.
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              Once you have reached your TG, talk to them to mine insights.
              These precious insights will lead you to their pain points that
              need to be worked upon to make your TG receptive to any novelty.
            </div>
            <div>
              Therefore, genesis of any idea should begin with the key insights
              and they should be imbibed in subsequent recommendations to make
              an idea worthwhile.
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2 text-blue">
              Step 6- Put your thinking caps on for a comprehensive solution.
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              The words comprehensive solution mean that all your suggestions
              should come together seamlessly as a single unified idea which is
              feasible for the organisation to implement in the first place.
              Take all your ideas and weave them together in a continuous
              fashion to make a natural progression from one part to another.
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              It is often tempting to give a lot of suggestions to show your
              creative acumen but please understand that it is not practically
              feasible to implement multiple ideas as there are execution and
              budget constraints. All you need is one winning idea so always
              strive for quality over quantity. The bottom line is Keep it
              simple, silly!
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2 text-blue">
              Step 7- Make the numbers talk.
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              So you have conceived a gem of an idea for brand activation which
              you ‚Äúfeel‚Äù will work wonders for the brand and make you win the
              case challenge. However, as clich√©d as it may sound Marketing is
              both an art and science. Giving a creative solution will only help
              you get the judges interested in your idea. For them to take it
              seriously, there must be supporting evidence which will increase
              their confidence in your recommendations.
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              What will be the Cost incurred? Is there some Revenue potential of
              your idea? Is your ROI worth all the effort? To put things in
              perspective, ask yourself this single most important question-
              Will my business proposal pass through the scrutiny of the Finance
              Department? If the answer is No then maybe you need to go back to
              the drawing board.
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2 text-blue">
              Step 8- Keep it real, keep a check.
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              We all learn early on in our B-school classes to have S.M.A.R.T.
              goals, the critical point which I would like to emphasise upon is
              to keep the goals time bound. All your recommendations must be
              well planned against a calendar to keep things under check when it
              comes to the execution part of your solution. A simple, feasible
              solution is so much better than a brilliant, non-implementable
              one.
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2 text-blue">
              Step 9- Make a power packed Power Point.
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              This step is all about putting your solution on a platter so that
              it is palatable to the recipients. Don‚Äôt fuss excessively over
              beautification of your Power Point presentation. Instead, focus on
              making your slides crisp and clutter free so that judges have to
              put in minimal efforts to comprehend your ideas. Visually
              appealing templates are easily available online, so focus your
              energies on Brevity over Beauty.
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              <span className="text-blue">
                Step 10- Congratulations for making it so far
              </span>{" "}
              (I was talking more about reaching the presentation round than
              reaching the end of this article), now all you need is to leverage
              your soft skills to get your idea the acceptance it deserves and
              get yourself that trophy!
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              The best practice we followed before all our presentation rounds
              was to have a mock presentation with our friends on the judging
              panel. We used to request our friends from different domains to
              sit through our pitch and shoot as hard questions as they could
              possibly come up with. Their diverse inclinations gave us a
              wide-ranging outsider perspective and helped us be better prepared
              to defend our ideas. By the time we were actually presenting to
              esteemed judges from diverse backgrounds, most of the questions
              were already expected by us which helped us answer calmly with
              confidence.
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              On a philosophical note, don‚Äôt focus too much on the outcome
              instead get your processes in place and then work like it is a
              real challenge and you are in-charge of getting things in order.
              Find out what works for you; try, fail but try again because when
              you finally get it right, the sense of accomplishment and the
              exposure gained matter much more than any other reward üôÇ Wish you
              a fun-filled learning journey ahead!
