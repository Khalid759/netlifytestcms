              With this summer prep series, we want to help you crack a PPO in
              your summers. And if your summers is in FMCD, you’re at the right
              place.

              Unlike FMCG, FMCD consists of slow moving consumer durables like
              televisions, washing machines, lightings, paints etc. which is not
              only for retailers but also for corporates & government. In
              addition to slow moving nature of durables, the main differences
              are the high ticket size, type of products and the way you push
              sales even during low demand cycles. Cracking a PPO in FMCD
              companies like Asian Paints, Samsung, Philips etc. can set you up
              for your career. To help you with this, we are going to decode a
              project to give you an idea about how to approach your summers
              project in FMCD.

              Understand the solvent based polish market and develop a GTM
              strategy for Ocian Paints to launch a product in the same

              <h3>Project Brief</h3>
            </div>
            <div>
              Solvent based polish is often applied as a protective undercoat to
              paint on most wooden furniture. It is also used as a primary low
              cost coat on wooden surfaces. The market for solvent based polish
              is primarily unorganized with many small regional players across
              different geographies. ‘Lak Daana’ or seed lakh is a wood polish
              made my harnessing the resin formed by the lac bug on trees. It is
              used in the major part of India as a substitute to solvent based
              polish. Ocian Paints sees an opportunity in the solvent based
              polish market in providing a branded high quality product for the
              market’s needs of a pre paint coating. It also wishes to act as
              the polish of choice over the traditionally used Lak Daana.

                  The pricing strategy for a newly developed product in the R&D
                  stage was a herculean task. This new product had to compete
                  with traditionally used substitutes that consumers were long
                  habituated of. Quality and convenience would be a key
                  parameter for Ocian Paints to win over traditional substances.
                  Pricing had to be value based and the only way to gauge what
                  value was being added was to conduct extensive market
                  immersion surveys on ground with dealers and contractors and
                  gauge how much they would be willing to pay
                </li>
                <li>
                  The wide scope of project enabled a hands on learning
                  experience of working on the 4Ps of marketing. This came with
                  its own set of challenges. Not only did the product itself
                  have to be defined with the R&D team but pricing had to be
                  done with the finance team, channels navigated with sales team
                  and promotion discussed with marketing team. Navigating all
                  stakeholders and sometimes having to compromise the interest
                  of one for the other was a challenge
                </li>
                <li>
                  Avoiding marketing myopia was another challenge. It was known
                  that Ocian Paints could come up with a superior product to
                  substitute Lak Daana. However, gauging whether there even was
                  demand for the product at a premium price was important.
                  Solvent based polishes were used as an outer layer of covering
                  without paint by highly price sensitive budget consumers and
                  those in the higher ranges considered it an extremely low
                  involvement product. Thus, sales channel members were targeted
                  and marketed to instead of end consumers based on the rating
                  scale developed for them
