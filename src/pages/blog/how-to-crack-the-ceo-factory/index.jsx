            </div>

            <div className="mtop-2">
              The above statement was posted by Unilever Careers’ FB page this
              April. Although it is clearly toned in a playful way with a whiff
              of that refreshing candour that companies seemed to have perfected
              on social networks, the statement still registers strongly with
              the listener.
            </div>

            <div className="mtop-2">
              <h3>“At HUL we start winning when we are still in diapers.”</h3>
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              It does, right? Had another company put this out, one could have
              dismissed it as a hollow claim of a corporate giant. With HUL,
              however, style tends to be backed by substance. This particular
              post was about HUL’s day care centre at their Andheri head office
              being ranked as the best pre-school in Mumbai and amongst the top
              4 nationally. It says something about a company’s winning
              philosophy when their day care centre not only aspires but becomes
              the best in Mumbai, besting players who are solely dedicated to
              the child day-care business.
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              Is it any surprise then that every year, scores of Sales &
              Marketing candidates put HUL as their dream company? Nielsen,
              which tracks recruiter preferences amongst B-school students, has
              had HUL at the top of their list every year for the past five
              years. When you think of all the companies across sectors new and
              old, and everything that has changed in the last 5 years, it is an
              astonishing achievement.
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              <h3>So what makes HUL so desirable to candidates?</h3>
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              Part of it has to do with its sheer size. As the biggest FMCG in
              India spanning a plethora of categories, the learning curve and
              the career opportunities are unmatched. However, dig just a little
              deeper, and you will come across the real reason why HUL is
              distinctive. This is not just another company. It’s a “Leadership
              Factory’, the only one of its kind.
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              The Company’s strong employer value proposition is rooted in its
              unique positioning as a ‘School of CEOs’ — offering big jobs very
              early on in career to groom for functional and leadership
              responsibilities.
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              HUL’s capability programs for their employees and summer interns
              are widely considered to be best in class, highly rigorous, and
              provide an amazing growth opportunity through the diversity of
              experiences: from rural immersions in Maharashtrian villages to
              treading international waters. Even the title of their summer
              internship program has “Leaders” inscribed. There is no wasting
              any time here! They know they are in the business of creating
              leaders and they start at the first very step.
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              <b>
                HUL’s employer value proposition of creating ‘Leaders’ is
                evident everywhere.
              </b>
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              Although this “Leaders build Leaders” philosophy has been derived
              from its global parent Unilever, it is HUL that has perfected the
              clay into a reliable functioning mould. HUL’s strong influence on
              its global parent, as evidenced by the number of HUL leaders
              holding key global leadership positions, is quite unusual for
              Indian subsidiaries. Fondly called ‘Mafia’ by their colleagues,
              these ‘Made in HUL’ leaders form the pulse of the global behemoth.
              All in all, HUL offers to take your career by the collar and put
              you on an ever-escalating journey of learning, opportunities and
              powerful leadership experiences.
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              So the obvious next question is: How does one prepare for its
              recruitment process? Having interviewed scores of recruiters and
              candidates, we have unearthed some key insights that could help
              you tame the lion.
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              First things first: Understand HUL’s Standards of Leadership
              (SOLs). SOLs are competencies that Unilever expects its employees
              to embody and showcase in every single job at hand. As a
              candidate, if you can demonstrate these behaviors through your
              past experiences and/ or key decisions, you will stand out as a
              clear culture fit. Below we have tried to explain each SOL and
              ways to demonstrate them in an interview:
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              <h3>1. Growth Mindset:</h3>
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              Definition: You have a positive attitude about the company’s
              future and a passion for growth and winning. You take the lead and
              seek fresh opportunities; insist on innovation and never settle
              for ‘good enough.’
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              To manifest a growth mindset in an interview, try finding past
              experiences in your life wherein you undertook the task with a
              clear intent to really ‘up’ the game. It can be your role in the
              marketing team of your under-grad college fest. Now how did you go
              about it? Was your benchmark the foot-falls achieved by the
              previous team, or did you aim to beat the best fest in the city or
              the country? People with a growth mindset are the ones who always
              hope for, believe in and work towards the best possible outcome.
              They challenge the status quo and push themselves and their team
              much beyond their ‘satisfactory’ performance.
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              <h3>2. Bias for action:</h3>
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              Definition: You bring a sense of urgency in getting things done
              and making tough decisions, avoiding over-debating or
              over-analyzing issues. You’re results-focused and drive for
              simplification by keeping the end goal in sight at all times.
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              Bias for action can be manifested in an interview by talking about
              your past experiences wherein you got things done. Find instances
              where you were absolutely execution focused. You realized that it
              is imperative to take a decision irrespective of the lack of
              information or challenges or the doubts that people surrounding
              you have. You escalated issues, inspired people or just rolled up
              your sleeves and did it yourself.
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              This SOL can be very critical in an HUL group discussion. An HUL
              GD simulates solving a problem under time and data constraints.
              Difficult decisions need to be made and key outputs to be
              delivered. Candidates who keep their cool, overcome conflicts,
              complexities & doubts, and stay results focused stand out clearly.
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              Let’s also correct a common misconception for HUL GDs.
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              No one likes overtly aggressive candidates in GDs!
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              There, we said it! Let your marketing logic and inter-personal
              skills help you lead the group towards solutions.
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              Group discussions: Don’t be that guy. Aggression doesn’t work.
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              <h3>3. Accountability & Responsibility:</h3>
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              Definition: You make commitments and hold yourself accountable for
              delivery. You take pride in delivering work to the highest
              standards and acknowledge when things are not up to scratch. You
              let people know clearly, in the beginning, what is expected in
              terms of performance and hold them accountable for delivery.
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              This SOL has integrity, consistency, and perseverance as their
              core personality facets. HUL invests significantly in its
              employees and obviously wants to make sure that the investment
              does not go down the drain on fickle-tempered individuals. You
              should be ready to keep fighting when the going gets tough. Hence,
              it constantly looks for perseverance as a quality that you have
              demonstrated in the past. It shows how you have persevered with
              good grades all through your high school & college or how you have
              persevered with a hobby and now have an in-depth understanding of
              that field.
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              <h3>4. Customer and Consumer Focus:</h3>
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              Definition: You have a passion to improve the lives of our
              consumers and customers and bring their voice into everything we
              do and the decisions we make. You are externally focused and go
              the extra mile in order to exceed consumer and customer
              expectations.
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              Applicants with work experience can demonstrate this competency
              through examples wherein they made an impact in the lives of a
              client or the end consumer. This SOL is not always possible to
              evaluate in an interview, especially for freshers. However, it can
              be manifested in your passion for solving consumer problems or in
              your intention towards finding consumer insights, which you
              believe are the real game changers.
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              <h3>5. Building Talents/Teams:</h3>
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              Definition: You inspire through action and lead by example. You
              challenge people to do their best work and spend time coaching
              individuals and teams to ensure that they realize their full
              potential. You constantly challenge yourself to grow and improve.
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              Again, this SOL is not something that is actively judged while
              recruiting a candidate. However, it can be manifested using
              experiences wherein you held positions of responsibilities and
              helped an individual or a group of people to escalate their
              potential.
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              <b>
                So what other things should you keep in mind while preparing?
              </b>
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              HUL puts a high value on analytical, logical and structured
              thinking. Don’t be impulsive in deciding your approach when the
              question is first posted. A marketing interview question rarely
              has a singular objective answer and it usually requires a well
              thought out structure to unearth category/consumer insights and
              then dovetailing them with the marketing objective using tools
              like STP, 4P, etc. Hence it is usually a good sign when as an
              interviewee you are thinking out loud. If you are unsure of
              something in the question, confirm it before proceeding. If you
              don’t have category context, admit it. This would help you turn
              the interview into being more of a brainstorming session with the
              interviewer and less of an interrogation. Even if in a specific
              question you are in a spot due to not knowing the terminologies or
              what route to adopt, you can always admit your knowledge
              status-quo and still wow the interviewer by the singularity of
              your logic. We have repeatedly seen ‘not-so-S&M focused’
              candidates convert HUL on the back of logical and structured
              answers.
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              Especially in summers, it is not so much about where you start
              from, but if you are hell bent on arriving at the solution using
              every tool you know. And one of the strongest tools at your
              disposal is your conversationalist flair. Once you can turn the
              question into a subject of extreme interest to you and have an
              engaging & ever-improving conversation with the interviewer, you
              are always in the hunt.
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              Showing a sharp learning curve is more important than knowing the
              exact solution that the interviewer has in mind.
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              What can really help you in this is involving the interviewer in
              the process of finding the solution. That, in turn, is a skill
              that can be worked on by giving quality mock interviews and
              putting yourself in the hot seat again and again.
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              Moving on from the softer aspects of the interview, there is a lot
              of credence in a candidate who has deep dived into every sales &
              marketing CV point that he/she has worked upon in the past. A
              candidate who has read up a lot about different categories and the
              current goings of the FMCG sector shows genuine interest and
              acumen. Specifically for finals, HUL expects in-depth knowledge of
              marketing concepts, especially the ones that you have worked on.
              Be ready with sharp questions on any of the projects, internships
              or case-studies that you have mentioned in your CV. The questions
              are generally focused either at the key concepts that you had
              used/studied, or your understanding of the sector you’d worked
              upon.
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              To sum it up, if you can demonstrate clarity with your own
              expectations and objectives in life, have made sense of the past
              in a way to learn from it and have made a strategy for the future,
              are clear about the basic marketing and sales concepts and have
              worked hard honing them leading up to the interview, and finally
              if you can stir up a marketing conversation with your passion and
              genuine curiosity for the subject, you are ready to own the Holy
              Grail.
