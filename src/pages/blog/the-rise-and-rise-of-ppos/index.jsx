              The Rise and rise of PPOs Life forces most of us to make certain
              decisions at different stages, decisions that we have to stick by.
              Right from choice of school, college and stream to who you should
              spend time with and what you want to make your career in. As we
              gain maturity and we start understanding the impact of these
              decisions, we want to be more careful in making them. For example,
              it is not considered wise to marry someone on the first date,
              unless you’re in Vegas ;).

              And companies are realising that too because employment nowadays
              is more than just a way to earn your bread, it is a commitment, a
              shared sense of responsibility and ownership.. They don’t ideally
              want to hire someone one the basis of one or two interactions!
              They want to be able to have “dated” each candidate for a short
              while, before they decide to make a commitment. They want to know
              beforehand how the candidate “performs” in different situations,
              and that is why they hire interns and offer PPOs to the select few
              who “satisfied” all their requirements!

            <div className="mtop-2">
              For companies, giving permanent job offers to interns is a way of
              finding employees who have demonstrated first-hand the right
              job-fit. After all, on-campus recruitments are a tedious process
              consuming several working hours of the company’s senior management
              and HRs. In addition to this cost, the outcome is uncertain with
              the possibility of candidates resigning after only a short stint
              with the company, or not being actually able to deliver the output
              quality and motivation that was required. PPO’s on the other hands
              are given only to candidates who demonstrate ability, persistence
              and right attitude for the position during their 8-week
              internship. Summer Internships are also a way for the companies to
              identify exceptional talent and groom them for the long run.
              Pavitra Singh, Head Talent Acquisition, PepsiCo India tells
              Hindustan Times – “Summer Internship programme is the main source
              for the Future Leaders Programme, where we hire management
              graduates from top B-schools, with the intent of building a
              general management pipeline”.

              For the students getting a PPO, it means a ready familiarity with
              the company’s work culture and ethos leading to a higher job
              satisfaction. Also, in these uncertain times having a job offer at
              hand eases the anxiety to a large extent during the placement
              season.

              <h3>The numbers say it all</h3>
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              The past few years have seen a rising salience of PPO’s in campus
              recruitments across the country. NMIMS Mumbai placed 245 of its
              students through PPO’s last year and the number has kept rising
              for every batch. At other prominent non-IIM B-schools like FMS,
              MDI and IIFT the number of PPO’s has been growing at a rate of
              more than 25% YoY. The trend is equally impressive across IIM’s.
              83 students at IIM Indore bagged PPO’s last year, while at IIM A
              the number was 79.
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              In fact, brands seem to be making a move towards recruiting
              students exclusively through PPOs. Godrej industries extended job
              offers to 91% of its summer interns as Management trainees in
              2016. While, more than half of the summer interns ended up with a
              job offer at Citi and Philips. TK Srirang, Head-HR, ICICI Bank
              tells Hindustan Times – “A summer internship programme is a key
              input for evaluating students for final placement. Every intern is
              critically evaluated by a panel of leaders for pre-placement
              offers and in the last few years, over 50% of the summer interns
              were given PPOs”. PPO’s are like the proverbial last slice of
              Pizza everyone is eager to grab. Even the B-Schools are eager to
              see this trend continue, for it eases the pressure on them during
              placements.

              <h3>Are PPO’s all good?</h3>
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              The sceptics among you must be wondering by now – Are PPOs really
              all that great? Well, you may be right. Despite the job security
              and the peace of mind one gets after securing a PPO, there are
              certain pitfalls you must be aware of. Firstly, you’ll only get a
              PPO in a company you interned at. Meaning if your SIP wasn’t what
              you desired, you might get stuck. Here’s the double whammy – if
              despite trying, you couldn’t get a summer internship in a sector
              you wanted, you face the dilemma of either making the best of the
              opportunity and risk getting offered a permanent job or you hold
              back and risk not learning as much you could have. Many B-schools
              implementing a strict “one job per person” rule compounds this
              issue. Talk about being caught between a rock and a hard place.

            <div className="mtop-2">
              However, even if the job market is not doing well, companies might
              cut down on their on-campus recruitments but continue offering
              PPOs to their best interns.

              <h3>How to get a PPO?</h3>
            </div>
            <div className="mtop-2">
              Having discussed the good and the bad of landing a PPO, the
              obvious question is – How to get hold of one? Well, there is no
              one right answer, but we can tell you what will definitely NOT get
              you a PPO with a guarantee. As per what you can do, one has to
              impress upon the superiors that he or she would be a valuable
              addition to the organization. This could be done, either by
              working hard and delivering the perfect project and/or by coming
              up with out of the box ideas and unconventional initiatives that
              may add to the company’s bottom line. In order to do that, one has
              to be prepared before the internship so that they can deliver
              value in the 2 months they are there, and our Brand Building &
              Sales Leadership programs will give you that advantage. If you’re
              not going in for an S&M internship, these are some guidelines on
              other things you can do to prepare for your summer internship. If
              the company you intern for has had a history of making the bulk of
              its recruitments through PPOs, you certainly stand a better chance
              of getting one.

              As the great General Eisenhower once said – Plans are useless but
              Planning is indispensable. So, plan and structure your internship
              from day one. Research exhaustively, work relentlessly and you
              just might end up with the PPO you always wanted!
