              Develop a go to market strategy for monetization of internally

              <h3>Project Brief</h3>
            </div>
            <div>
              Quipkart’s “super app” will be a one stop solution to consumers’
              E-Commerce needs. It will be launched as an integrated platform to
              carry out a vast variety of activities such as shopping online,
              booking event tickets, transferring funds. In a bid to engage with
              consumers at all touchpoints Quipkart’s internally developed games
              will also be present for users on the app and website to engage
              with. Currently Quipkart has 3 such games running, and players can
              win exciting rewards such as headphones, speakers etc. by playing
              the games and leveling up. These rewards are primarily to increase
              stickiness of the games with recurring players as well as onboard
              new players. Quipkart believes that the games space holds
              monetization potential in the form of ad revenue. As per the
              revenue model Quipkart will lease out ad space to brands that want
              to advertise to Quipkart’s large game playing audience.

                  Study of the current landscape of E-Commerce gamification was
                  done by analyzing competitors: Romazon and RayTM. Analysis
                  comprised of secondary research of publicly available
                  information as well as interviews with game players on these
                  platforms. Experiences of those who had participated in brand
                  sponsored quizzes on Romazon were collected.
                </li>
                <li>
                  It was found that the space had potential to be monetized and
                  Quipkart could win with the first mover advantage since
                  competition was not sustainably leveraging ad revenue in
                  games. Analysis of the games currently available of Quipkart’s
                  platform was done and consumer behavior studied through
                  analytics metrics such as average time spent.
                </li>
                <li>
                  User profiles were studied across 3 lakh game players and
                  target groups identified. A universal sample set was chosen
                  from the internally available data on demographic and
                  geographic details of game players and this was analyzed on
                  excel to come up with 12 hyper-segmented groups based on age
                  (2 groups), gender (2 groups) and type of game played (3
                  groups). (how to create cohorts & consumer immersions)
                </li>
                <li>
                  Key parameters were drawn basis product and category buying
                  behavior on Quipkart marketplace for each hyper-segmented
                  group.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Brands relevant to various TGs were contacted to pitch ad

                </li>
                <li>
                  Ideation was done on how to incorporate brand messaging
                  without hampering the experience of gaming. This was in
                  collaboration with the product development team to ensure a
                  smooth game playing experience with the advertisement not
                  taking away from the player’s immersive game playing
                  experience.
                </li>
                <li>
                  After thorough discussions with multiple stakeholders such as
                  a group of game players, internal development teams and the
                  client customized ads for each brand were suggested and rated
                  on a 5 point scale. A weighted average of these ratings was
                  used to decide the final appearance of the ad within or
                  outside the game.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Internal and competitor pricing for banner ads across web and

                  Innovating ad propositions such as in game advertising
                  suggested in order to smoothly integrate ads in user’s gaming
                  experience. Eg) For a quizzing game a sponsor’s question asked
                  as part of the quiz: when will YellowMi’s next generation
                  phone be released? Eg) Offering level ups in games or second
                  chances once a sponsor’s page is visited by the player.

                <li>

                  Suggested opportunities for leveraging games as an ad platform
                  to brands: new launches, pushing slow moving products,
                  sampling to a large and relevant audience.

                  Pricing of a large scale project in a new unexplored category
                  was a challenge. Competitor’s had not ventured into the space
                  and Quipkart was looking to leverage a first mover’s advantage
                  in tapping into gaming ad revenue. There were no external
                  benchmarks on pricing. Pricing had to be done by internally
                  benchmarking against other ad platforms such as home page
                  display ads.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Building trust with brands and on boarding them to this new ad
                  platform was challenging especially so for an intern who
                  couldn’t formally identify as an employee of the company.
                  Extensive pitch decks explaining the model had to be created
                  and constant follow ups with potential clients over E-mail and
                  phone were a regular part of the day. Demos of how their ad
                  would appear were also required by some clients. This was done
                  by overriding different brands on the gaming template.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Balancing the interests of the end users: gamers as well as
                  that of clients: brands was a trade-off. Interactions with
                  game players through self-conducted consumer immersions helped
                  understand their perspective. Key Account Managers were useful
                  in building relationships with brands to meet their
                  expectations.
